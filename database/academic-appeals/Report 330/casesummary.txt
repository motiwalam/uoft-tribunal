   Respondent

   Request for early return from a 36âmonth suspension due to poor
   academic performance. The Student claimed that he performed poorly due
   to his medical and financial circumstances. The Divisional Appeals
   Committee rejected the Studentâs submission that his circumstances had
   changed sufficiently to justify early return. There was no information
   before the Academic Appeals Committee to suggest that the Student has
   maintained steady employment, consulted with an academic counselor, or
   taken courses at a community college to upgrade his academic skills and
   study habits. As a result, there was no further information before the
   Committee to demonstrate a change in circumstances that could justify
   early return from suspension. Appeal dismissed.

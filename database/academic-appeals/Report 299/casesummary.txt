   UTM â late withdrawal without academic penalty â extension on course
   work afforded due to illness â illness impeded ability to complete term
   work â work for other courses completed not as complex â no medical
   evidence â aware of option to seek late withdrawal without academic
   penalty but chose to request extensions instead â appeal dismissed
   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from two courses.
   The Faculty had previously granted extensions on term work in the
   courses due to the Studentâs ongoing chest pain and anxiety attacks.
   The Student did not complete the term work and failed both courses. The
   Student claimed that his chest pains continued to impede his ability to
   complete the term work and that he was able to complete the work for
   other courses during the same time period because they were not as
   complex and required less work. The Student did not provide medical
   evidence pertaining to the period in question. The Committee found that
   the Student was aware of the option to seek late withdrawal without
   academic penalty and that he was capable of making the decision to do
   so but chose to request the extensions instead because he believed he
   would be able to complete the term work. The Committee found that there
   was no medical evidence to support any ongoing medical condition that
   would justify a further extension or late withdrawal without academic
   penalty. Appeal dismissed.

UTM – late withdrawal without academic penalty – extension on course work afforded due to illness – illness impeded ability to complete term work – work for other courses completed not as complex – no medical evidence – aware of option to seek late withdrawal without academic penalty but chose to request extensions instead – appeal dismissed

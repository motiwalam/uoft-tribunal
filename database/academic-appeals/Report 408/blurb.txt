UTM – Academic Appeals Subcommittee - petition for the lifting of a one-year suspension imposed for failing to maintain a required cumulative grade point average - it is neither possible nor desirable to lay down precise rules to govern the various special circumstances that may be in issue - it is not unreasonable for a University officer to expect a substantial degree of precision both in establishing the existence of special circumstances and in establishing a link between the special circumstances and the student’s failure to meet the requirements of the underlying regulations supported by such evidence as the nature of the particular case allows - appeal dismissed.

School of Graduate Studies – course grade appeal – program coordinator acted outside her scope of authority and recommended changing the grade from B+ to A- – course instructor re-read the paper and confirmed B+ – another faculty member re-read the paper and confirmed B+ – Student was treated incorrectly due to the procedural error – Divisional Appeal Board assigned a grade of CR – Committee could not raise the grade as the paper had been re-read twice by experts in the field and it had no authority to change a grade – CR designation was the most appropriate remedy as it helped the Student in that it would not reduce her average – appeal dismissed

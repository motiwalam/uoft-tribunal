   Request for a second extension of time to have term work graded in the
   course. The Faculty had granted the Student an extension to complete
   two term essays. The Student was first given a vague date as to the
   extended due date but the Faculty followedâup with a firm date soon
   after.Â  The due date was reâextended twice to accommodate the Student.
   The Student claimed that he had automotive problems on his drive back
   from a vacation weekend, and that he encountered lengthy lines at the
   library computer terminals when he went to use the libraryâs
   facilities. One of the two term essays was not delivered by the final
   revised deadline. The Student claimed that he submitted the second
   essay electronically before the revised deadline and later realized
   that it had not been received. Only the one term essay was graded and
   the Student failed the course. The Committee observed that the Student
   was given numerous extensions and had ample time to complete the
   assigned work, and that his failure to submit the second term paper by
   the extended deadline was a result of having left himself insufficient
   time to complete it. The Committee stated that the Faculty was not at
   fault for the Studentâs complaints. Appeal dismissed. The Committee
   recommended that the Faculty specify a firm time and date on which an
   assignment is due when granting extensions.

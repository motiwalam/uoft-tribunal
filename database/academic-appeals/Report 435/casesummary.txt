   FOR THE STUDENT APELLANT:

   The Student

   The Student filed two appeals from a decision made by the Toronto
   School of Theology Academic Appeals Committee (‚TST-AAC‚) that were
   heard together. The TST-AAC denied both appeals. The Student appeals
   and requests that the Committee reinstate them in the Toronto School of
   Theology (‚TST‚) ThD Program, notwithstanding their failing grades on
   the ThD Program Comprehensive exams. The Student‚s appeal raised a
   myriad of issues including the Student‚s perception of bias against
   them, whether the Student was appropriately accommodated for
   bereavement and disabilities, procedural misunderstandings about exam
   registration and timing, changes in the composition of their
   supervisory committee, and the fact that the Student felt stress and
   intimidation during the oral defence of one of the ThD program‚s
   compulsory Comprehensive Examinations. Several of these issues had been
   brought before the Committee and decided in two previous decisions.

   The Student first registered at the TST in September of 2012, and
   completed their course work in 2015. The Student was granted a leave of
   absence for the 2017-2018 academic year and returned to the TST in
   September of 2018. The Student was told by the Division that no further
   extensions or leaves would be made available to the Student and that
   the Student would be required to write all three of their Comprehensive
   Examinations (specialization, breadth, and analytic) by the end of
   August 2019. The Student did not receive a passing mark on any of the
   Comprehensive Examinations. The Committee decided in an earlier
   decision (Report 413) that the Student should be permitted to orally
   defend their Analytic Exam, and if that oral defence resulted in
   raising the mark on that exam to a passing mark, then the Student would
   be permitted to rewrite the remaining exams and to continue in the ThD
   Program. The Student was not successful in their oral defence but
   objected to the administration of the oral defence and appealed again
   to the Committee. The Senior Chair of the Committee, in Report 421,
   found that the remedy earlier granted by the Committee had been
   implemented in accordance with the terms as set forth in Report 413.

   The Committee concluded, based on its prior decisions in Reports 413
   and 421, that the TST accommodated the Student‚s requests up until the
   point of impairing the integrity of the oral defence, and that the
   TST‚s actions to protect academic integrity were neither unfair nor
   unreasonable.

   The Committee further concluded that there were no grounds on which it
   could retroactively dismiss the Student‚s grades on the Comprehensive
   Exams and rejected the Student‚s submission ‚ not raised in the two
   earlier appeals ‚ that the exams were unjust, and that the Student‚s
   deficient performance should therefore be disregarded in assessing
   whether the Student should be reinstated in the program.

   The Committee dismissed the appeal.

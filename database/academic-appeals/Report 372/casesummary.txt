   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from one course.
   The Student became ill while writing the exam for the Course and he was
   granted a deferred exam. Further medical issues caused him to miss the
   deferred exam. The Student then petitioned the Committee on
   Examinations (CE) for late withdrawal from the entire term. That
   petition was granted. The Student subsequently petitioned the CE again,
   stating that he had intended to seek late withdrawal only from the
   Course, not from the entire term. The CE granted the petition in part,
   vacating the decision withdrawing the Student from the entire term but
   refusing withdrawal from the Course, instead reinstating the deferred
   examination. The Student missed that deferred examination. The Student
   then petitioned the CE for retroactive withdrawal from the Course,
   supported by a University Verification of Student Illness or Injury
   form stating that the Student was significantly impaired in ability to
   fulfil academic obligations on the date of the deferred exam. The CE
   dismissed the petition without reasons.

   The Student then appealed to the Academic Appeals Board (AAB). The AAB
   dismissed the appeal, noting that no additional evidence was provided
   to support granting the exceptional request of late withdrawal without
   academic penalty (see [1]Report #348 ).

   The Student then appealed to the Academic Appeals Committee. The
   Committee noted that it was odd that the medical evidence placed before
   the CE was sufficient to justify the Studentâs late withdrawal from the
   entire term, but not for one course taken during that term. Though the
   Committee agreed with the Faculty that students should not be able to
   improve their transcripts retroactively by âcherry-pickingâ courses
   from which to withdraw late, in this case the Student was not
   attempting to cherry-pick but rather to find an appropriate solution
   for a difficult situation brought on by a number of medical problems.
   The Committee did not agree with the AAB that there was no additional
   evidence before it, noting that the Student submitted a medical
   explanation. The Committee found that the Facultyâs decision to
   evaluate the Studentâs performance on the basis of the examination
   originally written effectively unravelled the accommodation that the
   Faculty had granted him, as the Faculty had already recognized that
   that examination was not a proper test of the Studentâs understanding
   of the course material. The Committee concluded that this was not a
   fair application of the Facultyâs policies and that late withdrawal
   without academic penalty was an appropriate remedy for the Studentâs
   situation. Appeal allowed.

   The Committee denied the Facultyâs request to redact the names of all
   of the Facultyâs faculty and staff who were involved in the Studentâs
   case, noting that the fact that an individual was acting in an official
   or institutional capacity is not by itself a reason for redacting that
   personâs name (see [2]Report #367 ).

Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering – late withdrawal without academic penalty – medical issues caused the Student’s to miss his deferred examination on all of the scheduled dates – Faculty refused to allow further deferrals or withdrawal from the Course – Committee held that this situation was not one of a Student “cherry-picking” courses to improve his transcript, but rather one of trying to find an appropriate solution for a difficult situation brought on by medical problems – evaluating the Student on the basis of the examination that the Faculty had already recognized was not a proper test of his understanding of the Course material was not a fair application of the Faculty’s policies – appeal allowed

Faculty of Arts and Science – late withdrawal without academic penalty – time spent caring for ill family member and little experience with ways of a Canadian university – the Student finished the course, passed the course and sought only to drop the course with lowest grade – circumstances were beyond the Student’s control, unduly intrusive on the Student’s ability to study, and became progressively and unexpectedly worse past drop date – unlikely to seek help available due to focus on ill family member and newness to Canadian university – appeal allowed – grade in the course vacated and replaced with WDR

   Appeal from a grade of âDâ in the course.Â  The Student requested one
   of three remedies:Â  âAegrotatâ standing; âpassâ standing; or an
   increase from the grade of âDâ. The Student elected to write an essay
   worth 100% of the final grade. The Student sought review of the grade
   through a third party reader before applying to the Facultyâs Academic
   Standing Committee for aegrotat standing in the course. The Student
   claimed relief based on the excessive time she devoted to preliminary
   research while seeking topic approval, her frustrations in obtaining
   topic approval, the lack of guidance provided by the instructor in
   topic development and on the final topic, and the very late start date
   on which she had to begin writing the paper. The Committee considered
   the grounds upon which the Faculty awards aegrotat standing and found
   that the delay and frustration that the Student experienced met the
   definition of exceptional circumstances, despite no illness or a
   traumatic personal experience being suffered. The Committee found that
   due to the circumstances, the Student was unable to satisfactorily
   complete the requirements of a course where otherwise she would have
   performed successfully. Without the delay and frustration the student
   experienced researching topics she would have had more time to complete
   the assignment; with earlier instructions regarding the professorâs
   expectations for the paper and greater supervision once the topic was
   approved, she would have performed better; and the grade was
   inconsistent with the Studentâs other grades awarded at the Faculty.
   Appeal allowed. The Committee ordered that the grade of "D" be vacated
   and replaced with a grade of AEG. The Committee recommended that the
   Faculty provide its faculty, and particularly adjunct professors, with
   information regarding orientation, evaluation methods, and the
   obligations of its teaching staff.Â  The student also alleged
   unfairness related to the processes for appealing grades at the
   Faculty. The Student claimed that the third party reader received
   written information from the course professor regarding the
   circumstances relating to topic approval while she was not allowed to
   submit similar material. The Committee stated that the third party
   reader receiving extraneous comments was a violation of the procedure
   by which third party readers are meant to evaluate only the paper.

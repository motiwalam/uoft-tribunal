Faculty of Arts and Science – delay in filing petition – late withdrawal without academic penalty – request to re-write an examination – anxiety issues – Student’s particular health issues did not preclude him from checking his email or from filing an appeal in a timely manner, especially given that the Student was aware that an important decision was to be released, that the Student had prior experience with these academic processes, and that there is an obligation on students to check their emails regularly – appeal dismissed

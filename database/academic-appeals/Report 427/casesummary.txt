FOR THE Toronto SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY

   Catherine Fan, Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP

   The Student appeals a decision of the Toronto School of Theology
   Academic Appeals Committee (‚TST AAC‚) which denied the Student his
   appeal of his grade on his final research paper in the course WYB3743HF
   ‚Paul‚s Letter to the Galatians.‚ The Student is seeking to have this
   course taken off his academic record, or in the alternative, to have
   his failing grade substituted with a late withdrawal (‚LWD‚) or
   Aegrotat standing (‚AEG‚).

   The Student was enrolled in the Master of Theological Studies program
   at Knox College, which is part of the Toronto School of Theology
   (‚TST‚) at the University of Toronto. In Fall 2021, he was enrolled in
   two courses offered by Wycliffe College, also belonging to the TST. The
   courses were the aforementioned ‚Paul‚s Letter to the Galatians‚
   (‚Galatians‚) and WYB3641HF ‚Matthew‚s Story of Jesus‚ (‚Matthew‚). In
   December 2021 the Student was in a car accident and due to the ongoing
   effects of the accident, the Student requested and received extensions
   for his coursework in Galatians and Matthew. He was given extensions
   until January 5, 2022. He submitted his paper for Galatians on time but
   did not hand in his paper for Matthew until February 16. He received a
   failing grade on the Galatians paper on the basis that the paper did
   not meet the assignment requirements and a failing grade on the Matthew
   paper as he did not have an approved extension beyond January 5.

   The Student requested that the instructor re-read the assignment, after
   which the instructor gave detailed feedback, noting a number of
   deficiencies including the paper‚s failure to answer the assignment
   questions and requisite secondary sources. The Student requested a
   second reader and the second reader agreed with the failing grade. The
   Student then appealed his grades in Galatians and Matthew and received
   a hearing before the TST AAC, which denied his appeal for Galatians but
   granted it for Matthew.

   The Student raised several grounds of appeal for Galatians, which were
   all found by the TST AAC to be without merit. The TST AAC did provide a
   remedy for Matthew based on new medical information that was introduced
   and had not been known earlier. The TST AAC granted an extension, but
   the Student was unable to complete the paper and a grade of INC in the
   Matthew course was entered on the Student‚s transcript.

   The Student raised numerous grounds of appeal before the Committee. The
   key issues were the second reader review process and the question of
   consistency in medical reason academic accommodations. The Student
   argued that new evidence brought by the TST shows that Wycliffe College
   violated the second reader policy. The new evidence primarily refers to
   an email from the Academic Dean of Wycliffe College, Professor Peter
   Robinson, to the second reader. In the email Professor Robinson
   indicated that the instructor in Galatians gave the Student‚s paper a
   failing grade and offered to provide the second reader with the
   instructor‚s response and also quoted from an email that the Student
   had send, indicating the Student‚s views of Biblical scholarship linked
   to the paper were strongly contrary to mainstream scholarship.

   A reading of the TST Handbook shows that the second reader review
   process was not properly followed as the handbook states that the
   second reader should read the assignment without the evaluative
   comments of others. This was not the case here as the second reader was
   provided information and offered evaluative comments he should not have
   been. The TST argued that ‚evaluative comments‚ do not include
   providing the instructor‚s grade, but the Committee disagrees.

   The Student also appeals on the ground that his medical circumstances
   were accommodated by the TST AAC for Matthew but not for Galatians. The
   Student argued that the same rationale should apply to Galatians as
   without his car accident and the medical consequences, he would have
   been able to clarify the assignment requirements with the course
   instructors. The TST, in response, argued that the Student‚s ‚misguided
   views‚ rather than his health condition were responsible for his grade
   in Galatians. The TST also argued that its decision was reasonable
   because it was responding to the arguments the Student made and the
   Student had originally raised his medical issue in relation to Matthew
   and not Galatians. In Matthews the Student was granted an extension as,
   according to the handbook procedures, the Student was incapacitated.

   The Student provided detailed medical documentation to the TST AAC in
   October 2022. This was not previously made available to Wycliffe
   College or the Student‚s instructors. The question before the Committee
   is whether the TCT AAC decision was unreasonable because it did not
   also consider whether the Student should have been considered
   incapacitated for the purpose of Galatians and thereby allowed an
   extension even when he had not requested it. The Committee also finds
   that the question the TST AAC did not ask was whether, if the Galatians
   course instructor or Wycliffe College administration had the Student‚s
   medical information would they have tried to contact the Student to
   ensure he was not disadvantaged.

   The Committee found that the medical information submitted by the
   Student showed that he was dealing with the same medical issues prior
   to when he handed in his Galatians paper and when he was delayed in
   completing his Matthew paper. It would appear that the TST AAC did not
   consider the relevance of this medical information because it did not
   consider whether there should have been an accommodation for the
   Galatians course. The Committee finds that the fact that the TST AAC
   did not consider the possibility of accommodation for Galatians or even
   ask the Student if he felt disadvantaged by his medical condition was
   unreasonable.

   The Student asked the remedy of removal of the course from his
   transcript or, in the alternative, for either a LWD or AEG to be
   substituted for the failing grade. The Committee did not agree with
   removing the course from the transcript. The Committee found that
   Galatians and Matthew should have received consistent treatment for
   accommodations linked to medical reasons. Thus, the remedy the TST AAC
   granted for Matthew, an extension on the final paper or an INC on the
   Student‚s transcript, should have been granted for Galatians. The
   Committee was persuaded that the Student should receive the same option
   for Galatians too. While the Student did not ask directly for this
   remedy, the Committee found that one of his alternatives was for LWD to
   be entered, which is functionally similar to the INC. The Committee
   viewed this remedy as substantively consistent with what the Student
   asked for and granting it created no procedural unfairness.

   The appeal was allowed in part.

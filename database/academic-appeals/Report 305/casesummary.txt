   Request to increase the sessional average for the term, from 51.8% to
   54.8%, in order to enable the Student to proceed to the third year of
   his programme without repeating the failed term. The Student claimed
   that illness seriously affected his preparation for and performance in
   three examinations. In the subjects in which the examinations were
   written, the Student received two grades of F, and a grade of Câ. The
   Committee considered medical evidence, the Studentâs oral evidence and
   the studentâs academic performance in the term and found that the
   condition of the Student was not such that, but for the existence of
   the medical condition, the Student would have passed the term. The
   Committee found that the Studentâs attending physician did not consider
   that prescription medication or stronger nonâprescription medications
   was called for in treating the illness, and that the Studentâs weakness
   in term work also played a role in his poor results. The Committee
   observed that not every illness suffered during the examination period
   will excuse inadequate academic performance, particularly performance
   at the level demonstrated in the academic term in question, where
   weakness in term work also played a significant role in the poor
   results. Appeal dismissed.

FOR THE FACULTY OF ARTS AND SCIENCE:

   Erin McNab, Director, Faculty Governances & Curriculum Services

   Professor William Ju, Vice Dean, Undergraduate

   The Student appeals the decision by the Academic Appeal Committee of
   Faculty of Arts and Sciences which denied the Student‚s request to
   either revert her grade in an assignment to the original grade prior to
   the remarking, or to have another teaching assistant or the same
   teaching assistant from the course re-grade the assignment in BCH210H1,
   Biochemistry 1: Proteins, Lipids, and Metabolism.

   The Student enrolled in BCH210H1 during the Fall 2021. The assignment
   this appeal concerned was one of three assignments worth 15% in the
   course. The teaching assistant (‚TA‚) originally marked the Student‚s
   assignment and gave the Student a 78% grade. On the same day the
   Student learned of her grade, she contacted the course professor
   (‚Professor‚) and requested a regrade. In the new year, January 2022,
   the Student received a response from the Professor and was informed
   that the regrade mark was 56% which was a 22% drop in mark. The Student
   responded to the Professor concerned about the drop in grade and
   inquired about associated policies. The Professor informed the Student
   the grade was final, and that the Student should ‚try not to worry.‚

   The Student then reached out to her Registrar of the Academic Advising
   Office, Victoria College, to see how to appeal the 56% regrade. The
   Registrar asked the Student to reach out to the Undergraduate
   Administer (‚UG‚). The Student outlined in her requests to both the
   Registrar and the UG that she expected the re-grading to be done by the
   TA or another TA, yet the Professor did the regrade. The UG responded
   to the Student and confirmed that that the remarked assignment was
   final. The Student later received an email from Yvette Ali from the
   Registrar recommending the Student not pursue the matter further and
   live with the regraded assignment. The Student responded to the UG
   asking for a phone call conversation but never received a response. The
   Student wrote to the Registrar inquiring about an appeal process but
   did not receive a response until two days later where she was informed
   that the matter could not be escalated and though the department was
   not obligated to review an appeal request it was worth asking. The
   Student followed up with the Dean‚s Office. Over a two-month period,
   from January to March 2022, the Student engaged with and needed to
   follow-up on several occasions. Ultimately, the Student was informed by
   the acting Undergraduate Chair of the Department of Biochemistry that
   he supported the Professor‚s regrade. The Student then followed up with
   the Interim Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and later put
   together an appeal to the Faculty, which was sent to Vice Dean
   Undergraduate, Randy Boyagoda. The Vice Dean emailed the Student and
   informed her that her appeal was given fair consideration. The Student
   then appealed to the Faculty‚s Academic Appeals Committee but was
   dismissed with the Committee finding that the appropriate procedures
   were adhered to, the Student was treated fairly, and the marking
   standards applied were consistent with those applied to all other
   students who did the assignment.

   The Committee found that there was unfairness and inconsistency in the
   application of the relevant policies at issue in the appeal. The
   Committee questioned the fairness associated with the Professor not
   following policy to have the TA do the regrading and found that the
   Faculty Committee unfairly accepted the Faculty‚s argument that it
   would not have been appropriate to reach out to the TA outside of the
   terms of their contract. The Committee found that the 22% discrepancy
   raised a reasonable apprehension of bias on part of the Professor. This
   Committee disagreed with the previous which reasoned that given the low
   weight of the assignment the Student was not entitled to any remarking
   beyond the instructor level. The Committee found that the Special
   Consideration Appeal Policy should be implemented. The Committee also
   found the Student ought to have been promptly and clearly informed
   that, per the Special Considerations Policy, she could make an Academic
   Appeal in various stages. The Committee found that the Student was
   unfairly treated by the involved University Units, which resulted in an
   unreasonable delay and procedural unfairness. The Committee found that
   despite the Student finally being informed of her right to appeal, her
   appeals were not fairly heard or made through a demonstrably fair
   interpterion or application of the relevant policies. The Committee
   found that had the University Units involved followed the policies in
   place fairly, the process would have been prompt. Given the procedural
   unfairness and unreasonable delay experienced by the Student, the
   Committee found that reverting the Student‚s grade in the assignment to
   the original 78% was an appropriate remedy in the circumstances.

   The appeal was allowed.

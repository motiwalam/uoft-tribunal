   alternative request for late withdrawal without academic penalty â
   courses taken 15 years prior to appeal â university degree required in

   Request to graduate with a cumulative GPA of less than 1.50.
   Alternatively, the Student requested late withdrawal without academic
   penalty from three courses. The three courses were taken, and failed,
   15 years prior to the appeal. The Student claimed that his employer
   required him to have a university degree in order to keep his job. The
   Committee found that the Studentâs need to keep his job was not an
   adequate ground forÂ  granting relief especially after the passage of
   time and the number of attempts by the Student to reregister and to
   raise his cumulative GPA. The Committee found that it could not waive
   the Universityâs academic standards for reasons extraneous to the
   university environment. Appeal dismissed.

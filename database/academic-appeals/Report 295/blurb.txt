UTM – request to graduate with a cumulative GPA of less than 1.50 – alternative request for late withdrawal without academic penalty – courses taken 15 years prior to appeal – university degree required in order to keep job – inadequate ground for  granting relief especially after passage of time and number of attempts to reregister and raise cumulative GPA – cannot waive academic standards for employment needs – appeal dismissed

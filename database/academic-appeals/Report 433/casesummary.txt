   APPEARANCES:

   FOR THE STUDENT APPELLANT:

   The Student

   FOR THE SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES:

   Professor John Peever Vice Dean, Students

   The Student appealed the decision of the Graduate Academic Appeals
   Board (‚GAAB‚), denying her appeal of the School of Graduate Studies‚
   (‚SGS‚) decision to terminate the Student‚s registration in the PhD
   Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences. The decision to terminate the
   Student originated in the Graduate Department of Pharmaceutical
   Sciences Advisory Committee (the ‚Advisory Committee‚). The Student‚s
   registration in the PhD program had been previously terminated, though
   the Student was later reinstated by the GAAB.

   The Student challenged the GAAB‚s decision to terminate the Student‚s
   registration in the PhD program on several grounds. The Student
   asserted that the Advisory Committee‚s assessment of the Student‚s
   academic progress, relied on by the GAAB in its decision, was
   inaccurate. During the hearing, the Committee reviewed the written
   feedback of the Advisory Committee, contemporaneously recorded at the
   Advisory Committee‚s meetings with the Student. The Committee found
   that the written feedback form did not coincide with and, in fact,
   directly contradicted the Student‚s assertion that they had made
   sufficient academic progress. The Committee further noted that there
   was no evidence to support the Student‚s claim the Advisory Committee
   was unfairly biased towards them. The Committee did not find any
   support for the Student‚s assertion that their lack of academic
   progress was related to COVID-19 and its aftereffects.

   The Student raised two separate procedural issues. First, the Student
   argued that they were not required to pass a qualifying examination.
   The Committee noted that the Department requires qualifying
   examinations for PhD students, whether they enter the program after
   completing an MSc or after completing a BSc. The Committee further
   observed that the Student was aware of the qualifying examination
   requirement and noted that the Student had submitted a ‚Request for
   Extension to Achieve Candidacy‚ in which they explicitly acknowledged
   the qualifying exam requirement.

   The second procedural issue raised by the Student concerned the fact
   that one of the Student‚s co-supervisor, Dr. Suzanne Cadarette, served
   as the Advisory Committee‚s Chair ‚ an arrangement which violated a
   Department rule that the Advisory Committee Chair may not be a
   Supervisor or Co-Supervisor. The Committee found that while the
   Department deviated from its rule barring a supervisor from acting as
   an Advisory Committee Chair, it did so because it determined that Dr.
   Suzanne Cadarette was not acting as a substantive academic supervisor.
   The Committee further noted that the Student was informed of and agreed
   to such deviation from the rule, and in any event, the Student could
   not point to any harm to her progress caused by the rule modification
   that would otherwise warrant reversing the Department‚s decision to
   terminate the Student‚s registration.

   Lastly, the Committee considered the Student‚s submission that the
   University had made several missteps following the termination of the
   Student‚s registration in the PhD program. For example, the University
   mistakenly permitted the Student to engage in activities reserved only
   for actively enrolled graduate students and to upload a document to a
   platform meant to be reserved for current students only. The Committee
   concluded that none of the technical errors constituted re-registration
   in the Department and could not form the basis for establishing a
   student‚s academic status.

   The Committee concluded that the Advisory Committee correctly assessed
   that the Student was not making academic progress toward her degree,
   and that the termination of her registration was supported by the
   evidence. The appeal was dismissed.

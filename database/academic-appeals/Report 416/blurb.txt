Faculty of Medicine – closed hearing – request to find that the Board of Examiners decision was unreasonable, breached procedural fairness, and was discriminatory – request to expunge records of the reports and any negative evaluation – request for monetary damages – request that the Faculty undergo disability sensitivity training – request for the Academic Appeals Committee (the “Committee”) to order an external review to investigate and report on systemic barriers for persons with disabilities in the Faculty – the Student asserted that many of the problems identified in his performance were related to his disability – Ontario Human Rights Code – the time frame for the decision was not unreasonable – the decisions adequately considered the arguments made by the Student – the Student was not barred from presenting his arguments about individual outcomes of the patients he treated as part of his appeal – the University has an obligation to put accommodations in place that allow students to meet academic standards, but it is not to disregard or waive those academic standards for students with disabilities – the Faculty provided the prescribed academic accommodations that were intended to allow the Student to perform up to the standards of the program – it can only be the responsibility of the Student to monitor his personal well-being and take steps to optimize medications – not the duty of the Faculty to optimize his medical treatment – this was not a sudden or peremptory dismissal – the Faculty Council Appeals Committee’s decision was a reasonable application of policies designed to safeguard patient safety, and there was no evidence of discrimination or bias in the application of these policies to the Student – Appeal Dismissed

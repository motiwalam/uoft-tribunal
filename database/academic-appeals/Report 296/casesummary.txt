   UTM â late withdrawal without academic penalty â stress from combined
   workload â no reference to links with academic performance in medical
   evidence â no evidence of circumstances where adverse factors arose,
   unexpectedly continued, or unexpectedly significantly worsened after
   the drop date â Student had performance concerns by drop date but
   elected to remain â appeal dismissed
   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from five courses,
   all of which the student had failed. The Student claimed that stress
   resulting from the combined workload of fullâtime work and a
   fullâacademic programme affected his academic performance. The
   Committee considered the medical evidence submitted and found that it
   did not refer to possible links to the Studentâs performance in the
   courses. The Committee considered the Studentâs submissions and the
   University and Committeeâs approach to the policy on late withdrawal
   without academic penalty as described in Report #264 and found that
   there was no evidence of circumstances where adverse factors arose,
   unexpectedly continued, or unexpectedly significantly worsened after
   the âdrop date.â By the relevant drop date the Student was concerned
   about his performance in his courses yet he elected to remain in
   them.Â  Appeal dismissed.

Faculty of Arts and Science – Student appealed Faculty decision denying petition to substitute grade based on Faculty memorandum on special academic relief as a result of a teaching assistant (TA) strike at University – Faculty interpreted memorandum as requiring that only effect of the strike itself could be considered in deciding to award special grades to petitioning student - strict interpretation of Faculty rejected by AAC – as remedial provision, memorandum should be given expansive reading - students seeking relief from academic harm flowing from strike should not have to engage in statutory interpretation to select precise form of remedy to seek - remedies should be available when effects of strike are significant factor among others which cumulatively justify relief – effect of strike must be considered with respect to individual student, not some ‘typical’ student – Student sufficiently adversely affected by combination of strike and TA’s illness that relief should be granted - appeal allowed – grade of D- vacated and grade of CR substituted

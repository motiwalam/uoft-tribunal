UTSC – request to write deferred examination – subsequent request for late withdrawal without academic penalty – 3 examinations over two–day period – anxiety and stress – examinations were not consecutive – UTSC standard for medical documentation not met – rules regarding deferred examinations understood – no ameliorative steps to seek academic assistance or reduce course load – confusion regarding difference between UTSC policy and Faculty of Arts and Science policy did not sufficiently disadvantage Student – appeal dismissed

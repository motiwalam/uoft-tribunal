   For the University of Toronto Mississauga:
   Gordon Anderson, Chair, Academic Appeals Board, UTM
   UTM â late withdrawal without academic penalty â sudden deterioration
   of heath â Student did not attend hearing â assertion of improvement
   and then deterioration of health not credible â Student attended exam
   in another course during same period â appeal dismissed
   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from two courses
   due to illness. The Student did not attend the hearing. The Committee
   found that the Student had been given proper notice of the hearing but
   failed to attend without a reasonable excuse. The Committee made its
   decision based on the written material filed by the Student and
   material presented by the Faculty. The Student submitted that the
   decision not to withdraw in a timely fashion was due to the improvement
   in her medical condition and the sudden deterioration of her condition
   in late November. The Committee was not satisfied that the medical
   evidence submitted supported the Studentâs appeal. The Committee found
   that the assertion of improvement and then deterioration first surfaced
   in response to the Facultyâs decision that the Student should have
   withdrawn from the course due to the illness, and was not credible. The
   Committee found that the Student was able to attend the exam in another
   course during the same period and passed. Appeal dismissed.

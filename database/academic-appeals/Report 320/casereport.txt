Report #320 of the Academic Appeals Committee
June 22, 2007
Your Committee reports that it held a hearing on April 27, 2007 at which the following were
present:
Assistant Dean Kaye Joachim, Chair
Professor Jan Angus
Mr. Kristofer Coward
Professor Ellen Hodnett
Professor John Wedge
Ms. Nancy Smart, Judicial Affairs Officer

In Attendance:
The Student did not attend
For the University of Toronto Mississauga:
Gordon Anderson, Chair, Academic Appeals Board, UTM

The Appeal
This is an appeal for late withdrawal without academic penalty from PSY102H5F and
PSY340H5F.
Non-Attendance by Student
The Student did not attend the hearing scheduled for 9.30 a.m. on April 27th, 2007. The
committee waited until 10:10 a.m. and then proceeded to hear from UTM in her absence. The
Committee then adjourned and asked the Secretary to contact the Student to seek the reasons for
the non-attendance.
The Judicial Affairs Officer emailed the Student at her University email address on May 4, 2007;
by May 30, 2007 she had not received a response. The Committee finds that the Student, having
been given proper notice to attend the appeal, failed to do so without a reasonable excuse.
The Committee has made its decision based on the written material filed by the Student and the
material presented by UTM.
The Decision
The Student has been registered in Faculty of Arts & Science at University of Toronto,
Mississauga campus from fall 2002 to the present.

39536 v2

In the fall 2003 term the Student was granted late withdrawal in PSY220H5 without academic
penalty and advised that she would be held to faculty deadlines in the future. In summer 2004
the Student was granted late withdrawal without academic penalty in STA220H5 and in the fall
of 2004 was granted special permission to write a deferred exam in PHL274H5 and PSY344H5.
In fall of 2005 the Student was taking three courses: PSY201H5F and PSY340H5F and
PSY310H5. The student successfully completed PSY310H5 in the normal manner and obtained
a C+.
On December 14, 2005, the Student sought late withdrawal from PSY201H5F and PSY340H5F
due to illness during the term. This was denied and the Student scored failing grades of 30 and
26 in those courses.
At the initial petition hearing, the Student presented a medical note dated December 14, 2005
which stated that the Student had been ill throughout the term. The petition for late withdrawal
without academic penalty was denied on the basis that the Student should have withdrawn from
the course before the deadline in light of the illness.
At the Academic Appeals Board the Student submitted a second medical note dated May 2006
which stated that the Student had been seen on December 13 and 14, 2005 and reported being ill
from September 2005, but improved until mid-November and then deteriorated again in late
November 2005. The Student submitted in her notice of appeal that the decision not to withdraw
in a timely fashion was due to the improvement in her condition and the sudden deterioration of
her condition in late November.
The Committee is not satisfied that the medical evidence supports the Student’s appeal. The
evidence indicates that the Student first sought medical attention on December 13th, 2005 for a
condition that she asserted had been present since September 2005. The assertion of
improvement and then deterioration first surfaces in response to UTM’s decision that the Student
should have withdrawn from the course due to the illness, and is not credible. The Student was
able to attend the exam in another course, PSY310H5, during the same period and obtained a C+
The appeal is denied.

Respectfully submitted,
Kaye Joachim
Chair

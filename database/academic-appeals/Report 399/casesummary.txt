Appearances:

   The parties did not attend.

   The Student appeals a decision of the Office of the Registrar,
   Woodsworth College, refusing to register her as a non-degree student
   for the Summer of 2017 and Fall 2018 terms owing to outstanding
   balances in her account with the University. The Registrar acted
   pursuant to the Policy on Academic Sanctions for Students who have
   Outstanding University Obligations (the âPolicyâ), section 3.3 which
   provides that registration will be refused for a student who has
   outstanding obligations.Â  The Student argued that this section of the
   Policy did not apply to her because she was a ânew" student, and not a
   âcontinuingâ student.Â  The Chair referred to section 2.1 of the AAC
   terms of reference, which provide that the AACâs function is: âTo hear
   and consider appeals made by students against decisions of a faculty,
   college or school councils (or committees thereof) in the application
   of academic regulations and requirementsâ¦â The Chair explained that
   applications of academic regulations and requirements typically concern
   the merit of a studentâs work and the integrity of their academic
   record â such as course work, their standing in a program, or the
   reasonableness of a divisionâs decision in relation to an academic
   accommodation.Â  The Chair concluded that the consequences of the
   Studentsâ financial relationship with the University for her ability to
   register; whether she was a ânewâ or âcontinuingâ student was outside
   the jurisdiction of the AAC.Â  Appeal dismissed.

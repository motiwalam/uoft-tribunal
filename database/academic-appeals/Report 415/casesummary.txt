   Ms. E.L.Â (the âStudentâ) v. School of Graduate Studies

HEARING DATE:

   June 17, 2021, via Zoom

Senior Chair:

   Professor Hamish Stewart

Appearances:

For the Student Appellant:

   Ms. E.L. (the âStudentâ)

For the School of Graduate Studies:

   Ms. Denise Cooney, Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP
   Professor Martin Pickave, School of Graduate Studies

   TheÂ StudentÂ appealed aÂ decision of theÂ GAAB whichÂ dismissedÂ her
   appeal from a decision of the Chair of the Department of
   PhilosophyÂ (âDepartment Chairâ), declining to direct a reassessment of
   theÂ StudentâsÂ major research paper in PHL2117.
   TheÂ StudentâsÂ principalÂ remedyÂ soughtÂ isÂ an orderÂ from
   theÂ CommitteeÂ to the DepartmentÂ of Philosophy (âDepartmentâ)Â to
   have herÂ paper reassessed by two specific membersÂ of
   theÂ Department.Â The Student also seeks the
   followingÂ additionalÂ remedies:Â (1)Â that theÂ GDAAC disclose the
   number of rounds of voting that had occurred in order toÂ reach the
   decision inÂ herÂ appeal; (2)Â thatÂ the Department ChairÂ name or
   identify tenure track member(s) in the DepartmentÂ whoÂ are of Chinese
   ancestry during or after 2019; (3)Â that the Committee
   issueÂ anÂ orderÂ directingÂ aÂ specificÂ classmateÂ toÂ discloseÂ a
   copy of theirÂ major paper forÂ comparison; (4)Â that
   theÂ CommitteeÂ summonsesÂ a witness; and (5)Â thatÂ mattersÂ related
   to systemicÂ biasÂ shouldÂ fallÂ within the
   jurisdictionÂ ofÂ theÂ University academic appeal bodies.

   The ChairÂ of the Committee (âChairâ)Â reviewedÂ and decidedÂ whether
   the Committee had jurisdiction to grant any ofÂ theÂ additional
   remediesÂ sought by theÂ Student.Â With regard toÂ additional
   remediesÂ one and two, the Chair notedÂ that any
   questionsÂ regardingÂ theÂ ârounds of votingâÂ orÂ the number
   ofÂ members of the Department that are of
   ChineseÂ ancestryÂ isÂ irrelevant to the appeal. Regarding the
   thirdÂ additional remedy, the Chair notedÂ that theÂ GAAB
   andÂ theÂ Committee lack jurisdictionÂ to seek disclosure of another
   studentâs workÂ and even if there was such jurisdiction,
   theÂ StudentÂ did not provide any reasonable grounds to believe that
   reading the other studentâs paper would have assisted the Committee in
   deciding the appeal;Â the Committee is notÂ in a positionÂ to compare
   the quality of work between two students.Â RegardingÂ the fourth
   additional remedy, the Committee accepts theÂ StudentâsÂ description of
   the class discussion andÂ therefore, the summons would not be
   necessaryÂ for the purpose of this appealÂ and finally, the Chair noted
   that theÂ GAAB and theÂ CommitteeÂ doÂ notÂ andÂ can notÂ carry out
   investigations.

   TheÂ Studentâs request for a reassessment of her paper restedÂ on three
   principal submissions: (1) her major paper was not properly
   assessedÂ because of the Professorâs lack of expertiseÂ in the
   relevantÂ field of study; (2)Â the Professor was biased against her
   Chinese ancestry; and (3) the other student whoseÂ work, in the opinion
   of theÂ Student, was comparable in quality received an A and she did
   not.Â With respect to the first ground of appeal, the Committee noted
   that itÂ does not reassess academic work on itsÂ meritsÂ and it sees
   noÂ reason to doubtÂ the judgement of eight members of the Department
   who read the paper and wereÂ all ofÂ the view that it deserved, at
   most,Â a mark of B.Â The Committee further noted thatÂ regardless
   ofÂ whether or notÂ theÂ Professorâs knowledge was inferior to
   theÂ Studentâs,Â it didÂ not
   negateÂ theÂ StudentâsÂ responsibilityÂ toÂ provide a clear explanation
   of the relevant concepts and relate them to the subject matter,
   something theÂ StudentÂ did not do.

   Regarding the second ground of appeal, theÂ StudentâsÂ evidence of bias
   consisted of herÂ recountÂ ofÂ aÂ class meeting and the content
   ofÂ some tweetsÂ attributed to the ProfessorÂ regarding a shadow
   course.Â The Committee did not draw any inferences of bias from
   theÂ StudentâsÂ description of the class meeting.Â TheÂ Committee found
   that it shows, at most, an awkward moment in class.Â The tweets that
   theÂ StudentÂ attributed to the Professor were not authenticated,
   however,Â neitherÂ the Department nor SGS raised any issues
   pertainingÂ to their authenticity.Â Therefore, the Committee
   proceededÂ on the basis that they were authored by the
   Professor.Â TheÂ CommitteeÂ notedÂ that the tweets didÂ not indicate
   any bias towards theÂ StudentÂ and furthermore, the Committee could
   notÂ see how the Professorâs concernsÂ of a shadow course could
   influence his assessment of theÂ StudentâsÂ major paper.Â Regarding the
   third ground of appeal, the Committee has no evidentiary basis for
   comparing theÂ StudentâsÂ work with the work of another student.

   The Committee noted that the procedures followed byÂ the Professor, the
   Department Chair, the GDAAC, and the GAAB were
   appropriate.Â AppealÂ dismissed.

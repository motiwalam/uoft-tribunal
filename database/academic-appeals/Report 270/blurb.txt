UTSC – request to defer a one–year suspension – suspension served – request that notation of suspension be removed from transcript – personal and medical factors – most factors present prior to drop dates – parents' divorce could not have been foreseen – disadvantaged position exacerbated by news of parents’ divorce – request for deferred examination not easily granted – situation faced by the Student in short time between receipt of news and beginning of examinations militated against denying relief – Divisional Appeals Committee not able to weigh credibility – appeal allowed in part – suspension to be treated as deferred – no basis for removing notice of deferred suspension from transcript

UTSC – request for continued registration and leave to file late appeal –  not initially thought to be worthwhile to file appeal – lack of written notice of 90 day deadline played no part in failure to meet deadline – effective September 1, 2006, the right to appeal to Governing Council should be clearly communicated – University Policy on Academic Appeals within Divisions – section 3.2.1 the Terms of Reference –  no reasonable explanation or demonstrated exceptionable circumstances for delay – request for permission to file appeal beyond the 90 day deadline refused – appeal dismissed

   The Student appealed from a decision of the Graduate Academic Appeals
   Board ordering a re-read of the Student‚s paper. The University filed a
   motion for summary dismissal on the basis that the appeal had been
   brought out of time and on the ground that the appeal was frivolous and
   vexatious.

   The Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) determined that what the Student
   was really appealing was the procedure followed during the process of
   the re-reading of his paper. In dismissing the motion to quash the
   appeal on the ground that it was brought out of time, the AAC stated
   that it was clear that the Student was diligent in pursuing the appeal
   and if he was late at all, it was only a matter of a day or two. With
   regard to the motion for summary dismissal on the ground that the
   appeal was vexatious, the AAC noted that it was not incumbent on the
   Student at that stage to prove that the School of Graduate Studies
   (SGS) did not follow its own rules in ensuring that the re-reading of
   his paper was fair, impartial and without bias. The Student merely had
   to show that this was a possible interpretation of the events in
   question. The Committee was of the view that the Student had made out a
   sufficient case to warrant the hearing of the appeal, and dismissed the
   motion for summary dismissal.

   At the substantive hearing of the Student‚s appeal, the Student alleged
   that improper communications had occurred between SGS and the
   re-reader, that may have influenced the re-reader in his assessment.
   The University again moved that the matter be summarily dismissed as
   being frivolous or vexatious and as disclosing no proper grounds for
   appeal. The AAC was, however, of the opinion that one clause of the
   Student‚s Notice of Appeal, construed favourably towards the Student,
   could support his appeal. The University‚s motion for summary dismissal
   was therefore rejected.

   In determining the substantive merits of the appeal, the Committee
   found there was absolutely no credible evidence to support the
   Student‚s allegation of improper communication. It noted, however, that
   it was the practice of the University to send a copy of the re-reader's
   assessment to the student and to delete any comment not relevant to the
   assessment. The AAC stated that this was not a wise practice and that
   it was preferable, in its opinion, that the student be given an exact
   copy of the written assessment, save only for any matter that might
   disclose the identity of the re-reader.

   The Committee dismissed the appeal.

   FOR THE University of Toronto Mississauga:

   The Student is an undergraduate student registered with the Department
   of Chemical and Physical Sciences and the University of Toronto
   Mississauga. In Fall 2021, the Student enrolled in two courses, CHM231
   and CHM242, both of which he failed. As a result of the grades in those
   courses, the Student‚s cGPA fell below 1.5 and the Student was placed
   on a three-year academic suspension as of May 2022.

   The Student requested that the appeals of two decisions of the Academic
   Appeals Subcommittee (‚AAS‚) be heard together. The first appeal is of
   the decision of the AAS, refusing to grant NCR notations in the two
   courses. The second appeal is of the decision of the AAS, denying the
   Student‚s appeal for a lift of their three-year academic suspension.
   The Academic Appeals Committee (the ‚Committee‚) granted the Student‚s
   request that the two appeals be heard together, on the basis that the
   factual basis for both appeals were related.

   With respect to the first appeal, the Committee found that the AAS
   decision to uphold the decision of the Committee on Standing (‚COS‚)
   and deny the petition for the CR/NCR notation was reasonable on the
   basis that there was insufficient evidence to support the Student‚s
   contention that he requested the designation within the time limits of
   the policy. In particular, the Committee found that there was no
   evidence to support the Student‚s claim that his ACORN account had been
   compromised by hackers who allegedly had reversed the Student's timely
   request for the CR/NCR notation. The Committee reviewed the ACORN
   activity log, and concluded that the Student had provided no additional
   evidence to either challenge the accuracy of the ACORN records or
   explain why they were unable to register their request for the changed
   notation within the prescribed time limits. Accordingly, the Panel
   concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the Student‚s
   contention that they requested the designation within the time limits
   of the University‚s policy.

   With respect to the second appeal, the Committee considered whether the
   Student had presented compelling evidence of a change in circumstances
   to support an early return from his three-year academic suspension. The
   Committee noted that early return from suspension is an extraordinary
   remedy that is available only where a student produces compelling
   evidence of a change in circumstances relevant to the purposes of the
   suspension in question. The Committee found that, aside from
   demonstrating completion of the Promoting Academic Skills for Success
   program, the Student did not provide well-documented evidence that was
   sufficiently compelling to justify an early return from the Student‚s
   academic suspension, or to otherwise demonstrate a change in
   circumstances to indicate that their poor academic performance to date
   would not likely recur. As a result, the Committee found that the AAS
   decision was reasonable.

   The Committee dismissed both of the Student‚s appeals.

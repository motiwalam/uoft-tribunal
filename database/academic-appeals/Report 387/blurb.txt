Faculty of Nursing – request to void FZ grades – duty to accommodate – appeal started after three years is too long of delay when six month limitation – grounds to extend appeal – addressing appeal on merits and timeliness not mutually exclusive – Faculty need not offer all potential accommodations to meet fairness obligations to student – academic penalty is appropriate where students are informed in clearest possible terms of deadline and consequences of failure to meet deadlines – appeal dismissed

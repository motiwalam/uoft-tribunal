   request for deferral of threeâyear suspension dismissed - Student
   permitted to re-write final examinations in any or all of the courses
   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from three courses
   and the deferral of the threeâyear suspension, on medical and
   compassionate grounds. The Student failed the three courses and she was
   placed on the threeâyear suspension. The Student required 0.5 FCEs to
   graduate. The Student claimed that she was harassed on a regular basis
   by four students and that as a result she suffered physical and mental
   symptoms. The Student did not seek academic counseling nor did she
   attempt to drop any of her courses as recommended by the Faculty. The
   Student claimed that as a result of the death of her grandfather she
   suffered a depression which affected her performance on the final exams
   in the three courses. The Committee considered the medical
   documentation presented and the past history of the Student, including
   her evidence of past harassment. The Committee found that although the
   Studentâs academic performance may have been affected by her
   grandfatherâs death, she was performing poorly in the three courses
   prior to her grandfatherâs death. The Student was aware of her academic
   situation and the counseling services offered but chose not to avail
   herself of them. The Committee found that the harassment was not a
   factor in her poor performance for the three courses in question. The
   Committee considered the Studentâs graduation requirements, the
   negative impact that her grandfatherâs death may have had on her exam
   performance, and the Facultyâs willingness to have allowed the Student
   to re-write her final exams had she requested to, and found that the
   Student should be permitted to re-write the final examinations in the
   three courses. Appeal allowed in part. Request for retroactive late
   withdrawal from the three courses denied. Request for a deferral of the
   threeâyear suspension denied. The Committee ordered that the Student
   could elect to re-write the final examinations in any or all of the
   three courses. In default of timely notification, the Student was
   deemed to have elected not to pursue the remedy.

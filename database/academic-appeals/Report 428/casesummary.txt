   APPEARANCES:

   FOR THE STUDENT APPELLANT:

   The Student

   FOR THE TORONTO SCHOOL OF THEOLOGY

   Catherine Fan, Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP

   The Student was enrolled in the Master of Theological Studies program
   at Knox College, which is part of the Toronto School of Theology (TST).
   The Student appealed a failing grade in a course, asking to receive
   either a notation of late withdrawal without penalty (LWD) or aegrotat
   standing (AEG) for the course.

   In an earlier decision (Report #427), the Committee allowed the
   Student‚s appeal and gave him an election as to the remedy, namely a
   choice between (i) resubmitting an essay and receiving a grade for the
   course and (ii) receiving a notation of incomplete (INC) in the course.
   As of the date of the hearing in this case, the Student had yet to make
   their election. The Student submitted to the Committee that the
   decision in Report #427 did not impose a ‚deadline‚ to make such
   decision.

   TST applied for directions concerning the implementation of the remedy.
   The Senior Chair held that the Committee had jurisdiction to make
   directions concerning the implementation of a remedy. The Senior Chair
   agreed that their decision in Report #427 did not impose a deadline but
   held that the Committee intended the Student to make their election
   within a reasonable time. The Senior Chair also inferred that the
   Committee in Report #427 intended INC to be the default remedy. The
   Student stated that they required certain information from TST, namely
   an email between the course professor and the re-grader, before making
   their election and agreed to make their election promptly on receiving
   it.

   The Senior Chair found that the Student had received the information he
   requested. The Senior Chair found that the Student was therefore in a
   position to make their election. In the event that the Student did not
   make an election within a reasonable time, the Senior Chair authorized
   TST to assign the Student a notation of INC.

Toronto School of Theology (TST) – appeal from TST decision terminating Student’s candidacy for degree of Doctor of Theology – Notice of Appeal to Academic Appeals Committee filed late – exceptional circumstances apply because TST’s own appeal committee erred in refusing jurisdiction to hear Student’s appeal – underlying purpose of exception is to prevent general rule from causing inequity – adequate notice of right to appeal not given to Student – seeking legal advice does not displace exceptional circumstances and cannot of itself create a strict new time period – appeal allowed – matter remitted to Graduate Studies Council Academic Appeals Committee

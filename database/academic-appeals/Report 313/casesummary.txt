   Request to graduate with a cumulative GPA of less than 1.50. The
   Student had completed all other degree requirements. The Student
   claimed that his cumulative GPA had been calculated incorrectly. The
   Student claimed that the grades from his transfer credits from courses
   taken at York University should have been transferred to the University
   of Toronto. The Committee considered the grades submitted by the
   Student and the University's policy of refusing to transfer grades from
   other institutions. The Committee found that even with transfer credit
   grades, the Studentâs cumulative GPA would still have been below that
   required to graduate; that the Universityâs policy of refusing to
   transfer grades from other institutions was a sound one, since there
   may be significant differences between programs; that the Student was
   aware of theÂ  policy at the time of his transfer to UTM; and that the
   Studentâs transfer credits had appeared on his transcript each semester
   with no grades attached, and that the annual GPA and cumulative GPA
   calculations did not include his grades from York University. Appeal
   dismissed. The Committee observed that, given the serious impact that a
   failing grade has on a studentâs GPA, borderline grades should attract
   review from a Facultyâs administration.Â  The Committee registered
   concern about fairness to students who are experiencing serious
   academic difficulty.

   Request to change a failing course grade. The Student‚s projects for
   the course were reevaluated twice by his course instructor. The
   Divisional Appeals Committee ordered that the Student‚s performance be
   re-evaluated by a new examiner. On the reevaluation the Student
   received a failing mark. The Committee found that any possible flaws
   from the previous evaluations were cured once the reevaluation by the
   new examiner took place. The Committee found no basis for the Student‚s
   claim that the new examiner lacked the qualifications to conduct the
   reevaluation. The Committee considered the Student‚s objections to the
   procedures pursued by the examiner and found that the Student had not
   made out any case of unfairness. The Student‚s lower grade in the
   reevaluation did not undermine the strength or fairness of the
   reevaluation; the new examiner was not obliged to consult with the
   course instructor in regards to the reevaluation; and the new examiner
   acted properly in conducting the reevaluation independently. The
   Committee considered the Student‚s objection to the substance of the
   grade and found that it did not have the jurisdiction to reevaluate the
   Student‚s course work, and that there was no reason to do so, given the
   new evaluator‚s expertise and the fairness of the reevaluation process.
   Appeal dismissed. The Committee noted that the Student had tape
   recorded one of his conversations with the new examiner. The Committee
   observed that recording a conversation with a member of the university
   community without that person‚s consent is contrary to the atmosphere
   of good faith in which the business of the university is conducted.

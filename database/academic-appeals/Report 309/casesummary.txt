   Assistant Dean Bonnie Goldberg, Chair
   Mr Husain Aboghodieh
   Professor Yuki Johnson

   Dr. Anthony Gray
   In Attendance:
   The Student, the appellant
   Associate Dean Nick Cheng, UTSC
   UTSC â late withdrawal without academic penalty â decision to
   withdrawal but after deadline â medical circumstances â Student aware
   of deadlines â sufficient information about progress to make informed
   decision â insufficient medical evidence â appeal dismissed
   Request for permission to withdraw late without academic penalty from
   one course. The Studentâs selfâassessment of her performance caused her
   to decide to withdraw from the course, but not until after the
   deadline. The Student claimed that she suffered stressâinduced
   migraines, aggravated by her parentsâ divorce. The Studentâs physical
   illness was not raised at any previous level. The Student submitted a
   medical note that referred to a history of migraines to substantiate
   her claim. The Committee considered the grounds presented by the
   student in the petition and the appeal and found that the Faculty and
   the Divisional Appeals Committee made the appropriate decision based on
   the information available. While the Student was new to the UTSC
   system, she was aware of the deadlines and she had sufficient
   information about her progress in the course to make an informed
   decision before the deadline. The Committee found that the new medical
   evidence submitted at the hearing was insufficient to find that the
   Faculty or the Divisional Appeals Committee erred in its decision or
   that a different result should have been reached. Appeal dismissed.

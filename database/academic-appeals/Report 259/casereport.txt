For the University of Toronto at Scarborough:

The student appealed from a decision of the Scarborough Sub-Committee on Academic
Appeals dated June 20, 2001, dismissing his appeal from the decision of the Scarborough
Sub-Committee on Standing dated September 13, 2000, refusing his petition of
September 8, 2000 to rewrite the final examination in the 2000 Summer Session course
CHM 133H.
On August 14, 2000, the student failed the final exam in CHM 133H and as a result failed
the course. His sessional GPA fell to 0.00 and his cumulative GPA fell to 1.49, and
pursuant to policy at the University of Toronto at Scarborough (“UTSC”), he was
automatically placed on three-year suspension from the University. The student seeks the
remedy of retroactive late withdrawal from CHM 133H and permission to re-enroll in
courses in January 2002. The student’s appeal is based on medical and compassionate
grounds.

Report Number 259 of the Academic Appeals Committee
The Facts:
From the Fall of 1991 to the Fall of 2000 the student was periodically enrolled as a part
time student at UTSC. Throughout the period 1992 to 2000 the student performed poorly
and was on academic probation in every session in which he was registered for failure to
meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirement of 1.60. During this period of time he
was also placed on a one-year suspension following the 1993 Winter session, and a threeyear suspension in 1999 for failure to meet the requirements of his academic probation.
The three-year suspension was later deferred, and the student was warned in writing that
if he failed to achieve a sessional GPA of 1.60 his three year suspension would
automatically be triggered. He was also strongly advised to carefully evaluate his
situation in each course before the deadline for withdrawing without academic penalty.
In 1999 the student suffered a series of set backs in his personal life. In April 1999, he
was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. In December 1999, the student’s aunt, who had
been very close to him, passed away. In March 2000, the student’s girlfriend terminated
their five-year relationship. In April 2000, the student’s parents asked him to move out
of their home. In that same month, the student was demoted in his position at work.
In May 2000, the student enrolled in CHM 133H, a summer session course. The student
also enrolled in ANA 300Y but dropped that course prior to the course drop deadline of
July 23, 2000. The student retained his registration in CHM 133H but performed poorly
on his term work. He missed two term tests on June 20th and July 25th and obtained a
20% average on term quizzes. The student was permitted to write the final exam reweighted to compensate for the work that he had missed.
On August 14, 2000 the student failed the final exam for CHM 133H, achieving 5 to 7%,
and as a result failed the course. His sessional GPA fell to 0.00 and his cumulative GPA
fell to 1.49, and pursuant to policy at UTSC he was immediately placed on three-year
suspension.
On September 8, 2000 the student filed a petition to the Scarborough Sub-Committee on
Standing asking for permission to rewrite the final examination in CHM 133H on
medical grounds. The student argued that his chronic sinusitis caused him to suffer from
nausea, headaches, and an ear infection as a result affected his ability to prepare for and
write the final exam. A University of Toronto Student Medical Certificate from Dr. Betty
Choi-Fung dated August 14, 2000 supported the petition. The student’s petition was
denied on September 13, 2000 on the grounds that he was aware of his chronic medical
problem and his poor performance in the course, and therefore he could have reasonably
anticipated difficulty in completing the course and withdrawn from the course prior to the
course drop deadline of July 23, 2000.
On May 30, 2001 the student appealed this decision to the Scarborough Sub-Committee
on Academic Appeals. He asked for one of three remedies – late withdrawal from CHM
133H; permission to rewrite the final exam in CHM 133H; or a reduction of his threeyear suspension to one year to be permitted to return to studies in September 2001. The

student argued that the cumulative effect of the personal stressors in his life affected his
ability to concentrate, and ultimately caused him to suffer a depression in May 2000,
which was unrecognized and undiagnosed until February 2001. He argued that although
he was aware that he faced a three-year suspension if he did poorly, he found it difficult
to make rational decisions because of his then unrecognized depressive disorder. He
introduced medical evidence to support his case. The appeal was denied. While the
members of the panel were sympathetic to the student’s ongoing health problems, they
noted that he had already been granted one deferral of suspension, there was no
significant difference on the student’s performance on the quiz and the final exam, and
the remedy of late withdrawal should be reserved for extremely rare cases.
In the present appeal, the student is seeking the remedy of late withdrawal without
academic penalty. He argued that his chronic sinusitis, in conjunction with his
depression during the relevant time period caused him to fail CHM 133H and further
interfered with his ability to make the rational decision to withdraw from the course. The
student introduced a new piece of evidence, a letter from Dr. Parviz Jamal dated August
2001, which outlined the stressors the student had been facing which precipitated his
depression.
Decision
A retroactive late withdrawal from a course is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the
most serious cases. The Committee considered all of the medical and other evidence
submitted by the student. It was the opinion of the Committee that the medical evidence
did not meet the test for granting the extraordinary remedy of late withdrawal. The
student had been warned in writing and knew the consequences of failing even one
course. The committee also noted that the student had decided to drop another course in
which he had been enrolled during the summer of 2000, yet had decided to remain in
CHM 133H. The Committee was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that even if
the student had been suffering from a depression during the summer session of 2000 that
the depression was the cause of his failed exam in CHM 133H or his decision not to
withdraw from CHM 133H prior to the course deadline for withdrawal.
The appeal is dismissed.

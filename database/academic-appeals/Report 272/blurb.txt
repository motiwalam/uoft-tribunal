UTSC – request to write a deferred examination – student visited dying family member abroad – had family member died then conditions for special considerations would be met and petition granted – see Faculty’s policy on deferred exams – reasonable to consider visit to dying family member to be equally appropriate “special circumstance” – no position to predict course of family member’s fatal illness – need to travel abroad a factor beyond Student’s control – Divisional Appeals Committee did not have complete information before it – Divisional Appeals Committee was under mistaken impression that the Student was failing course – error sufficient to undermine fair process – appeal allowed – Student permitted to write deferred examination in course

UTSC – re-read of term work and final exam – appeal dismissed – professor had no intention of doing anything contrary to Divisional policy – amenability of a faculty member to performing a re-read is not relevant to the question of whether a re-read is justified – Student failed to present substantive arguments – reliance on conclusory statements and unsubstantiated allegations – a student’s precarious academic situation does not constitute a substantive reason for a re-read

Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering  – Student appealed Faculty decision determining no basis to alter assessed grade awarded to Student – Faculty erred in procedure used for assessing Student’s grade –  where Faculty offers assessed grades rather than supplemental examinations cannot do so in opaque manner - no compelling argument why Faculty did not use formula outlined in its ‘Term Work Report’ – instructor’s comments valuable but should not form basis of assessment – Faculty must be held to its own test set out in ‘Term Work Report’ – appeal allowed

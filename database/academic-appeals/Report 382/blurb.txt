Toronto School of Theology – exemption from program requirements – Student wanted to transfer from the ThD program to the Faculty’s new PhD program without completing the application requirements – Student appealed to the Committee rather than pursuing further internal appeals, but this was not a basis for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Student – Student was arguing against the fairness of the policy itself, not the policy’s application, so the matter was outside of the Committee’s jurisdiction – Student did not take advantage of the opportunities available to him to transfer programs – appeal dismissed

   Request to transfer from the ThD program into the new PhD program in
   the research doctorate in theological studies without being required to
   complete two further courses. The Student did not apply to the bridging
   program designed to allow transfer into the new PhD program despite
   knowledge of this option, and instead wrote to the Director of the TST
   requesting to transfer from âThDâ into âPhDâ nomenclature. The Student
   petitioned to the Advanced Degree Appeals Division of the TST, stating
   that he had not been permitted transfer in the nomenclature without
   being required to complete two further courses. At the hearing, the
   Student submitted evidence supporting his claims that he had
   substantially met the outcomes of the Required Courses given that he
   had authored an academic book, taught and designed an undergraduate
   course, and spent time in the learning community in Trinity College,
   and stated that it would have been a serious delay in his studies to
   have taken the courses. The Academic Appeals Committee of the GSC
   denied the Studentâs petition, noting that the Student did not choose
   apply to the PhD program through the existing bridging option, and did
   not find the arguments made in support of his appeal persuasive. The
   matter was sent back to the Faculty to determine whether there was room
   for exploration of an accommodation within the existing bridging
   option.

   The Student then appealed to the Academic Appeals Committee, requesting
   a declaration that he had met the academic requirements set out by the
   TST for transfer from the ThD into the PhD program through equivalency
   to the Required Courses, and directing the TST to transfer him into the
   PhD program immediately. The Committee noted the unusual manner in
   which the appeal came before it: the GSC decision did not decide on the
   merits of the Studentâs appeal but instead sent the matter back to an
   earlier stage in the appeals process, and the Student then appealed to
   the Committee. The Committee also noted that no adverse inference
   should be drawn against the Student for coming before the Committee
   rather than pursuing further internal appeals.

   With respect to the Committeeâs jurisdiction to provide the remedy
   requested by the Student, the Committee noted that its role is not to
   change Faculty policy but rather to ensure that a policy was applied
   fairly and consistently. The Committee found that the Student was in
   effect arguing about the fairness of the Facultyâs policy, not about
   the fairness of the application of the policy to the Student. (See
   Reports [1]#368 , [2]#359-1 , and [3]#371 .) Despite some procedural
   fairness issues relating to the transparency and updating of the TSTâs
   Handbook and processes, the Committee concluded that the Student was
   not treated unfairly. The Committee took into account the fact that the
   Student did not avail himself of his many opportunities to enter the
   bridging program, that he did not approach the TST to see if he could
   obtain an exemption from the requirements in a timely manner, and that
   he did not take advantage of the ample opportunities the TST provided
   him with to seek resolution of his appeal. The Committee also rejected
   the Studentâs assertion that the process was procedurally unfair
   because of a lack of reasons by the Academic Appeals Committee of the
   GSC, noting that the GSC decision sent the matter back to an earlier
   stage in the appeals process and gave reasons for this decision. The
   Committee encouraged the TST and the Student to work together to seek
   if they could find a solution. Appeal dismissed.

UTM – late withdrawal without academic penalty – unexpected personal circumstances – Faculty custom to grant late withdrawal, once only per student, when requested before final examination – circumstances lasted longer than could reasonably be expected – cultural reasons led Student to give greater weight to advice of teaching assistant – grade must be evaluated against class average – minority opinion that circumstances at the drop date required a decision to either lighten load or take a chance on being unable to overcome difficulties – appeal allowed – grade of F vacated, retroactive withdraw without academic penalty allowed

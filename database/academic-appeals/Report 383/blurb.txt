School of Graduate Studies – reinstatement to program – Student failed two courses – personal and familial difficulties – Departmental policy recommends expulsion when students fail two courses – new medical evidence was of too limited a nature to support a finding that the GAAB had been unreasonable – in some cases, it is appropriate for the Committee to take the Student’s actions following the events central to the appeal into account, but here taking the Student’s later successes into account did not affect the reasonability of the GAAB decision – Student’s unsuccessful appeal of one of the failed courses contributed to the reasonability of the GAAB’s decision – appeal dismissed

UT –  Faculty of Law – request to return to the program on a part-time basis with appropriate accommodations – duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship – reasonable accommodation – jurisdiction – standard of review of correctness vs reasonableness – jurisdiction cannot be created by consent (Phillips and Phillips v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 161; Canada (Attorney General) v. Haberman, 2000 CanLII 15802 (Fed. C.A.)  – the Committee’s function does not extend to invalidating the policies of a division, even if it is of the view that those policies are flawed or unfair – Terms of Reference Academic Appeals Committee (“Terms”) – although the Terms do not explicitly define the standard of review, the Policy on Academic Appeals within Divisions (2005) states that the “standard of review of an academic appeal is reasonableness.” –  s. 17(1) and (2) of the Human Rights Code (“Code”) – Academic Accommodations Policy – academic accommodations contribute to academic integrity by attempting to ensure that the extraneous factor of disability does not affect a student’s reported results; they are not designed to guarantee that the student succeeds – it is not contrary to the Code to refuse an accommodation that would compromise academic integrity – Student had three unsuccessful, heavily supported, attempts at completing the first year of the program – no realistic basis in which the Student would be likely to succeed in the program regardless of accommodation – dissent – allowing the Student to continue part-time is a reasonable accommodation of his disability – the Student’s history has no bearing on whether part-time studies would now be an appropriate accommodation – the majority Committee agreed with the Academic Standing Committee – appeal dismissed.

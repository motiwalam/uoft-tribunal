   This appealÂ stemsÂ from a decisionÂ of the Accommodations Committee to
   denyÂ the Student the ability to resume his studies on a part-time
   basis. The Student appealed this decision with the Associate Dean of
   the Faculty which upheld the decision.Â The Student then petitioned to
   the Facultyâs Academic Standing Committee (âASCâ); the ASC dismissed
   his petition.Â The Student appeals to the Academic Appeals Committee
   (âCommitteeâ).Â The Student is seekingÂ an order permitting him to
   complete his remaining work for the first year of the program and then
   to resume studies at the Faculty on aÂ part-time basis with appropriate
   accommodation.

   A few procedural and legal issues arose at the Hearing in which the
   Chair reviewed and determinedÂ these without assistance of the
   otherÂ CommitteeÂ members.

   FirstÂ is the issue as toÂ whetherÂ the Committee has
   jurisdictionÂ toÂ hear or decide any issues pertaining to this
   matter.Â The Student submitted that theÂ Committee has jurisdiction to
   review the decision of the ASC and the Division conceded that the
   Committee has jurisdiction.Â The Chair noted thatÂ the Facultyâs
   concession is not determinative becauseÂ jurisdiction cannot be created
   by consentÂ (Phillips and Phillips v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 161 at
   p. 164;Â Canada (Attorney General) v. Haberman, 2000Â CanLIIÂ 15802
   (Fed. C.A.) at para. 20).Â The Chair noted thatÂ theÂ Accommodations
   Committee as well as theÂ ASCÂ were concerned about whether they had
   jurisdictionÂ over the Studentâs request. The ASC chose to proceed on
   the assumption that it hadÂ jurisdiction, therefore, the appeal to the
   Committee proceeded on the same assumption.Â In the Chairâs view,
   jurisdiction in this matter depends on the proper characterization of
   the Studentâs request and the response by the Deans.Â There are three
   ways to characterize the request and response. First, the Student
   inquired into his status at theÂ FacultyÂ and, in response, the Dean
   provided the Student information about his status.Â In this view, there
   would be no application of any of the Facultyâs policies and there
   would be no decision to appeal from and thus, the Committee would lack
   jurisdiction over this matter.Â Second, the Student requested an
   accommodation and the Accommodations Committee hadÂ jurisdiction over
   that request even though the Student was no longer registered.Â In this
   view, the jurisdiction of the ASC and the AAC
   isÂ straightforward.Â Third, the Student requested
   anÂ accommodationÂ and the Accommodations Committee did not have
   jurisdiction over that requestÂ becauseÂ the Student was no longer
   registered.Â Thus, theÂ AAC would also not have
   jurisdiction.Â TheÂ ChairÂ foundÂ that the AAC does have jurisdiction
   over this appeal on either the second or third characterization of the
   Studentâs requestÂ because the Faculty was applying its accommodation
   policy.Â Therefore, the CommitteeÂ has jurisdiction over the Facultyâs
   response to the Studentâs request.

   The secondÂ issueÂ relates toÂ the appropriate standard of review.Â The
   Student requested that the CommitteeÂ conductÂ aÂ de novoÂ review of
   the Facultyâs response to the Studentâs request and determine whether
   that response was correct.Â The Chair indicated thatÂ although the
   Terms do not explicitly define the standard of review, theÂ Policy on
   Academic Appeals within DivisionsÂ (2005)Â states that the âstandard of
   review of an academic appeal is reasonableness.âÂ The ChairÂ found that
   the issue before the Committee is the reasonableness of the decision
   being challenged by theÂ Student appellant,Â whetherÂ or notÂ it
   exercises its powers to receive additional evidence.Â The Chair was
   extremely reluctant to hold that a decision made by the ASC should be
   reviewed for correctness rather than for reasonableness.Â The Chair
   found thatÂ if the Committee were to adopt a standard of review of
   correctness there would still beÂ a strong element of reasonableness
   embedded in that standard because the duty to accommodate is a duty of
   reasonable accommodation.Â The Chair found that the issue before the
   Committee is whether the Facultyâs overall response to the Studentâs
   request was a reasonable application of the Facultyâs duty to
   accommodateÂ in accordance with its accommodation policy.

   Lastly, theÂ Chair addressedÂ the Universityâs duty to accommodate in
   accordance with theÂ Human Rights CodeÂ (Code).Â The Chair outlined
   that the University is obligated to reasonablyÂ accommodate a person
   with a disability to the point of undue hardship. Section 17(1)Â of
   theÂ CodeÂ indicatesÂ that the Studentâs rights would not be violated
   if he isÂ âincapableâÂ of meetingÂ the requirements to successfully
   complete the academic program, however s. 17(2) of theÂ CodeÂ would
   direct the Committee not to find the StudentÂ âincapableâÂ unless his
   disability âcannot be accommodated without undue
   hardship.âÂ WhetherÂ or notÂ academic integrityÂ can be considered in
   determining undueÂ hardship under s. 17(2), it is better considered in
   relation to âthe essential duties or requirements attending the
   exercise of the rightâ under s. 17(1).Â Academic accommodations
   contribute to academic integrity by attempting to ensure that the
   extraneous factor of disability does not affect a studentâs reported
   results; they are notÂ designed to guarantee that the student
   succeeds.Â TheÂ University should not provide an accommodation that
   compromises academic integrity,Â whetherÂ or notÂ doing so would amount
   to undue hardship, because it would not be possible to fairly assess a
   studentâs performance under such an accommodation.Â An accommodation
   inconsistent with academic integrity is of no value in determining
   whether a student is capableÂ ofÂ âperforming or fulfilling the
   essential duties or requirementsâ of their academic program.Â It is not
   contrary to theÂ CodeÂ to refuse an accommodation that would compromise
   academic integrity because, if a student is unable to succeed without
   such an accommodation, that student âis incapable of performing or
   fulfilling the essential duties or requirements attending the exercise
   of the right because of disability.â

   The Student raised two main issues in his appeal. The first is with
   respect to procedural fairness and the second isÂ the duty to
   accommodate.Â The StudentÂ allegationÂ surrounding procedural fairness
   wasÂ based on the fact thatÂ the Student did not get an opportunity
   toÂ respondÂ toÂ the FacultyâsÂ submissions or attend the ASC meeting
   to make oral submissions, while the Faculty was.Â The Committee
   foundÂ thatÂ the Faculty did not deny the Student procedural fairness
   because the procedureÂ with respect to the Studentâs petition was in
   accordance with the ASCâs rules.Â The Committee
   furtherÂ heldÂ thatÂ itsÂ function does not extend to invalidating the
   policies of a division, even ifÂ it isÂ of the view that those policies
   are flawed or unfair. Therefore, for the CommitteeÂ to
   allowÂ anÂ appeal on the basis that a university division had acted
   unfairly even though it followed its own procedures would be tantamount
   to invalidating that policy and, as a remedy, would require the
   creation of ad hoc procedures on a case-by-case basis.

   The second issue on appeal is the duty to accommodate.Â The question
   before the Committee isÂ whetherÂ the Facultyâs refusal to offer the
   additional accommodations as requested by the Student was in accordance
   with its duty to reasonably accommodate his disability.Â The
   CommitteeÂ was divided on whether the Facultyâs decision not to grant
   these accommodations was a reasonable exercise of its duty to
   accommodate.Â The majorityÂ ofÂ theÂ CommitteeÂ found thatÂ over the
   last number of years the FacultyÂ had provided the Student with
   extensive accommodations, yet despite these accommodations, the Student
   could not complete the first year of the program.Â The majority
   Committee agreedÂ with the ASC that the Student âhas had three
   unsuccessful, heavily supported attempts at completing
   theÂ first-yearÂ programâ¦Â There is no realistic basis which we can
   have confidence that [the Student] is likely to succeed in the program
   even if undertaken on a part-time basis.â

   Appeal dismissed.

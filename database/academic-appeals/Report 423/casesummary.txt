   The Student appeals the decision of the Faculty of Arts and Science
   communicating that the Student was not entitled to further re-grading
   of a quiz in the Winter 2020 term of BIO251H1, Form, Function and
   Development of Plants.

   The quiz this appeal pertained to was administered March 2020. The
   Student emailed the instructor the day after and raised his concern
   that of the 4 true/false questions on the quiz, three were not
   testable. The Student did not at any point assert that his answers to
   the questions were correct. Instead, the Student challenged the
   fairness of the instructor‚s decision to include the questions. The
   Student posited that the materials had not been covered in what
   students in the course had been asked to study at the time the quiz was
   given. The instructor provided the Student with his quiz in April 2020
   and two days later, informed the Student that if he wanted to request a
   regrade, he needed to respond by 12:00 pm on April 19. The Student
   responded with a request for a regrade on April 19, at 10:51 pm. The
   instructor informed the Student he had missed the window to request a
   regrade. The Student asserted that the timeframe the instructor
   provided was not reasonable and inconsistent with both the information
   about requests in the syllabus or University policies.

   The Committee was persuaded that the instructor‚s handling of the
   Student‚s request was inconsistent with Faculty of Arts and Science
   policies as the less-than-two-day-timeframe was not reasonable and the
   Student was entitled to twelve more days than he received. The problem
   was resolved the next day when the instructor forwarded the email
   exchange to the Associate Chair, Undergraduate, of the Ecology and
   Evolutionary Biology department. The Associate Chair responded to the
   Student informing him that he could request a regrade and also added
   that the questions of concern in the quiz had been verified by the
   professor and TAs as consistent with learning expectations and
   resources provided to students. Through this email the Associate Chair
   addressed the Student‚s substantive concerns regarding the validity of
   the questions. The Student continued to escalate the matter and
   repeatedly asserted that no one had addressed his underlying concerns
   and suggested that he had yet to have an academic with the appropriate
   background and training review his claims.

   At issue in this appeal was the process and outcome of the Student‚s
   request for a regrade of a quiz that was administered in the Winter
   2020 term of BIO251H1. The appeal addressed the following questions: 1)
   Was the material covered in Quiz 3 testable?, 2) Did the Student‚s
   instructor correctly state the policies regarding regrades on her
   syllabus or in her emails to the Student?, 3) Did the Student receive a
   fair and substantive review of his concerns?, 4) Did the Faculty follow
   Faculty policies and apply them fairly in following up with the
   Student?, 5) Is the Student entitled to further review of his score?,
   6) Is the Student entitled to any of the additional remedies he
   requested?, and 7) Should the instructor‚s regrade apply?

   The Committee found that the material was testable as the instructor
   noted the three ways the material had been covered and the TAs verified
   this assessment. The Committee found that the Student‚s instructor did
   not correctly state the policies of the Faculty‚two errors were
   identified. First, the quiz should have been first regraded by the TA
   who marked it and not the instructor. Second, the instructor gave the
   Student an unreasonably short time period to submit his request. The
   Committee found that the Student eventually received a fair and
   substantive review, as the course TAs also verified the instructor‚s
   assessment that the material has been presented and was thereby
   testable. The Committee also found that while the instructor was
   inconsistent with Faculty policies, the administrators at the Faculty
   who were notified of the issue by the instructor followed their
   policies. The Student asked for another review after receiving the
   first regrade of the quiz, this time reviewed by three qualified
   reviewers. The Committee found that the assignment, because it was
   weighted so slightly, did not warrant the Student‚s request. The
   Committee found that while the outcome was not what the Student wanted,
   it was fair and explained with reasoning. Finally, the Committee
   considered whether the instructor‚s regrade should have been applied.
   The Committee noted that the Student was very firm in not wanting the
   revised mark applied because he did not want the instructor to perform
   the regrade. The Committee agreed with the Student that the original,
   non-revised, mark should stand.

   The Student was frustrated by what he viewed as the instructor‚s
   unreasonable behaviour and violation of University policies. The
   Committee agreed that the instructor made errors but noted that the
   errors were quickly addressed and corrected by the Faculty and the
   Student was not academically harmed by the procedural mistakes. The
   Committee found that the primary remedy sought by the Student was not
   proportionate to the incident and not necessary as a qualified regrade
   took place. The other concerns the Student raised were beyond the
   Committee‚s jurisdiction and better suited to human resources. The
   Committee found that the Student received a fair regrade and is not
   entitled to a further review.

   Appeal was dismissed.

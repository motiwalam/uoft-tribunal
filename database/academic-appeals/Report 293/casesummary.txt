   Request to proceed to Year 3 of Pharmacy program, despite not having
   met the academic requirements. Request made on financial grounds
   unrelated to failing grade.Â  The Faculty Appeals Committee heard the
   appeal despite not usually considering financial hardship as ground of
   appeal and despite the Student not having submitted a petition. The
   Committee found that the Student did not take proactive steps, or seek
   academic assistance offered by the Division to improve academic
   performance. Not all available means of financial support had been
   exhausted.Â  There was no merit to the Studentâs allegation of
   differential treatment. There was no evidence of extenuating
   circumstances directly related to academic performance. The Committee
   stated that it does not have the jurisdiction to remove a failing grade
   due to financial considerations. Appeal dismissed.

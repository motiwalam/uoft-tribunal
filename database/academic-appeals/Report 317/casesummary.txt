For UTM:

   Gordon Anderson, Chair, Academic Appeals Board, UTM

   Request for late withdrawal from two courses due to the Studentâs
   ongoing anxiety and depression, and leave to file a late appeal to a
   subsequent decision of the Divisional Appeal Board denying late
   withdrawal from two other courses.Â  The Committee considered the
   medical evidence presented and found that it did not suggest that the
   Studentâs medical condition prevented or hindered her from withdrawing
   from two of the courses in a timely fashion. The Committee found that
   the Studentâs claim that the subsequent lowering of her GPA was
   disproportionate to the âwrongâ of failing to withdraw in time was not
   a valid reason for granting late withdrawal. The Committee considered
   the Studentâs intention to file the notice of appeal to the Divisional
   Appeal Board decision denying her request for late withdrawal from two
   of the courses and found that in the circumstances, combined with the
   lack of any prejudice to UTM, it would be unduly technical to deny her
   leave to file a late appeal. The Committee found that that the medical
   evidence directly connected the Studentâs medical state with missing
   the drop deadline. Appeal allowed in part. The Committee allowed leave
   to withdraw without academic penalty from two courses and denied leave
   to withdraw without academic penalty from two courses.

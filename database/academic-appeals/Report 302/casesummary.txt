   Request to withdraw late without academic penalty from one course. The
   Student claimed that she suffered unforeseeable mental and physical
   difficulties following a car accident and was unable to participate in
   the course from mid‚March until the end of term. The Division Appeal
   Committee granted permission to re-write the final examination. The
   Student rewrote the examination but also continued the appeal, seeking
   the original remedy. The Committee found that that the divisional
   remedy to re-write the examination was unreasonable in light of the
   factors contributing to the Student‚s inability to participate in the
   course. The Committee accepted the Student‚s contention that already
   pre‚existing circumstances became significantly more severe following
   the drop date and that it was not possible to foresee her worsening
   medical condition. Appeal allowed. Late withdrawal without academic
   penalty granted. The Committee observed that although it does not have
   jurisdiction to make such orders, it accepts that students should not
   be entitled to refunds of courses for which they are granted late
   withdrawal without academic penalty.

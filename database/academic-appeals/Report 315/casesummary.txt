   the Student Appellant
   For UTM: Professor G. J. Anderson
   UTM â late withdrawal without academic penalty â mental health issues â
   stress from criminal charges â drop date after Studentâs acquittal of
   criminal charges â no evidence of any change in mental health problems
   after drop date â appeal dismissed
   Request for late withdrawal without academic penalty from three
   courses.Â  The Student failed all three courses. Before and during the
   relevant period the Student was under psychiatric treatment. The
   Student was diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder, Major
   Depression and Impulse Control Disorder. The Committee considered the
   studentâs history of mental health issues and other external factors
   which allegedly distracted him from his studies, including preparation
   for and concern about his trial for a serious criminal offence. The
   Committee found that the drop date for the courses was after the
   Studentâs acquittal and there was no evidence of any change in the
   Studentâs mental health problems after the drop date. The Committee
   found that the pressure and duty the Student felt to his parents did
   not justify a departure from the Universityâs policy regarding drop
   dates. Appeal dismissed.

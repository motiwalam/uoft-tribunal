SGS – request for late withdrawal without academic penalty; grading of tests; recommendation of rebate or cancellation of tuition – Students did not write their exams and received FZ grades – their cases were being decided together because they were almost identical – Committee held in Motion Decision #359-1 that it did not have the jurisdiction to grant the other remedies Students requested – male Student’s father died one month before the exams – between the time of the father’s death and about one month after the exams, Students made no request for special consideration – Committee accepted the male Student’s claim that it took him 1.5 months to recover but found that they failed to demonstrate why their circumstances were so severe as to prevent making a request for special consideration – Committee did not find credible the claim that the Student did not make such a request because he had the impression that it would not be granted – no evidence as to the circumstances of the female Student’s circumstances – Students’ tests should not be graded because they were not registered at the time – no reason to recommend rebate or cancellation of tuition as their FZ grades stand – appeal dismissed

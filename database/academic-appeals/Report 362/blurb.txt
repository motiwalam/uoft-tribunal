Student appeals decision of University of Toronto Mississauga Academic Appeals Board dismissing appeal from decision of Committee on Standing denying Student’s request to lift one-year suspension – early return from suspension is an extraordinary remedy – such remedy not appropriate unless Student produces compelling evidence of change in circumstances relevant to purposes of suspension – only issue is whether Student has produced compelling evidence of requisite change in circumstances – early return from suspension normally only granted where substantive and well-documented change in Student’s circumstances indicating previous record of poor academic performance not likely to recur - appeal dismissed

Faculty of Law – course grade appeal – request to change grade on transcript from “B” to “Credit” and to be issued an apology from the Faculty – Student disputed the Faculty’s policy disallowing the appeal of interim grades – no basis for the Student to appeal the Faculty’s policy – role of the Committee is to review the application of Faculty policies, not to change the policies – appeal dismissed

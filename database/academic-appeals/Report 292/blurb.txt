Woodsworth – grade appeal – flaws in the training and “feedback” processes of the practicum – the position of the Student was not significantly different from that of other students in similar placements – teacher trainers not required to submit interim reports – recommendation that teacher trainers be required to submit an interim report to the Faculty, with a copy being given to the student – weight of required instruction unclear – recommendation that the weight of the instruction must be determined and published in advance if it is to be evaluated in determining final results – not probable that the Student would have passed the practicum had the procedural matters not existed – appeal dismissed – Faculty advised that the Student could retake the practicum, while retaining credit for other courses taken – recommendation that fees be waived should Student repeat the practicum

Scarborough Subcommittee on Academic Appeals – appeal of decision refusing late withdrawal without academic penalty – Student’s petition based on disruption to course arising from Teaching Assistant strike at the University – while Student showed poor judgment in remaining in course, Student may still have passed course but for disruption caused by strike - important guiding principle that in all but the most extraordinary cases, late withdrawals after failure has been recorded should not be granted - retroactive withdrawals from failed courses are an extraordinary remedy – effect of strike for Student may have proved insurmountable - circumstances very much a function of the Student’s unique characteristics and not meant to diminish standard by which late withdrawals for academic penalty are granted - appeal allowed

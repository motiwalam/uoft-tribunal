Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering – Student appealed Faculty decision that missed final examination should not be counted in computing final course mark – Student petition based on medical grounds – attack on credibility always relevant in considering evidence – where University grants relief on medical grounds, it accepts that student’s ability to perform so adversely affected that results cannot be relied upon – academic delinquency irrelevant in determining this issue – University cannot deal with academic delinquency by withholding otherwise proper relief on petition based on medical or similar grounds – where character of party impugned, witness should be present to be cross-examined – Faculty committees did not publish reasons for decisions – elementary fairness requires publication of summary of reasons for decision at a minimum - appeal allowed

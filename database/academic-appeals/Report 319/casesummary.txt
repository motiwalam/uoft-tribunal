   UTSC â request to re-write final examination â alternative request for
   aegrotat standing â Faculty appropriately applied its policies â
   special treatment of other students not substantiated â appeal
   dismissed
   Request to re-write the final examination in a course. In the
   alternative, the Student requested that he receive a grade of aegrotat
   in the course.Â  The Committee found that the Faculty fairly applied
   its policies regarding rewriting final exams and granting no credit or
   aegrotat standing: the Studentâs marks were lower than the 10% drop
   threshold, relative to the class average, from term to final exam mark;
   he had no significant incomplete work; all his grades were below Câ;
   and there was no medical evidence that indicated that he was unable to
   complete his work. The Committee found that the Studentâs concerns
   about special treatment of other students were not substantiated.
   Appeal dismissed.

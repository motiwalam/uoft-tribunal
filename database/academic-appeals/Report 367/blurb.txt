Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering – re-instatement to program – Student was refused further registration due to poor academic performance – Faculty allowed the appeal in part, but did not provide reasons for its decision to not allow reinstatement – Committee noted that the Faculty should have provided written reasons for its decision, but the absence of reasons did not change the outcome of the Student’s petition – Student attended classes and completed some coursework for the courses he would have taken had he been reinstated – Student argued that the Faculty erred procedurally by not instructing him on which documentation to submit – AAB dismissed the appeal – reinstatement not appropriate given the Student’s poor assessment in the courses thus far and the timeline of the evidence submitted – divisions of the University should encourage students to support their appeals with suitable documentation, but it remains the Student’s responsibility to submit suitable documentation – Committee agreed with the AAB and concluded that its decision was reasonable – to grant a remedy that would give the Student credit for the courses would be highly unusual given that he wasn’t enrolled in them and the basis for assessing his performance in them was very thin – Faculty staff names need not be redacted, especially when the matter does not affect them in a personal capacity – appeal dismissed

Faculty of Arts and Science – request to write deferred examination and extension on course work – treatment for psychiatric illness – teaching style and course expectations unreasonable – abusive instructor – instructor’s demands not excessive – instructor’s counter–reactions did not exceed permissible bounds – Faculty recommended late withdrawal without academic penalty – deferred standing not appropriate – request to complete course in a manner not consistent with original course – stigma from notation of “withdrawal without academic penalty” not as bad as notation of “fail” – appeal allowed – if the Student accepted late withdrawal without academic penalty within thirty days of release of the decision then the grade of “F” would be vacated, and a notation of WDR substituted – if the Student did not accept the relief then the appeal would be dismissed

Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering – request to substitute new marks for marks received in course assessments – grade appeal – extraordinary external pressures – Faculty granted retroactive withdrawal without academic penalty – remedy rejected – request that grades be raised by between 5.5 and 10 marks – remedy sought not afforded by Faculty and too speculative – awarding of grades is function of appropriate faculty – role of appeal tribunals – appeal dismissed

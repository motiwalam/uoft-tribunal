THE PLEA
3.

The Student did not appear in person at the hearing, but he did appear through his counsel,
Neil Wilson. Counsel for the Student indicated that he would not be entering a plea and
would not be challenging the evidence. In effect, this was equivalent to a no contest plea.
The hearing proceeded on the basis that the UniveiÂ·sity would nonetheless prove its case even
though the Student would not be challenging the evidence.

THE FACTS
4.

The Student was registered at the University of Toronto at the St. George Campus in the
Faculty of Arts and Science, majoring in computer science. He was registered in CSC 369
HIF (the "Course").

The Course was being taught by Professor Karen Reid with the

assistance of a teaching assistant Jacqueline Bermudez.
5.

In the fall term of 2014, the Student hacked into the University of Toronto's computer system
and he gained access to Ms. Bermudez's computer account. He then used the account to
change his mark in Assignment #1 from an incomplete grade to 20/40 on October 27, 2014
and 33/40 on October 29, 2014. This conduct occmTed in the period from October 24 to
October 29, 2014.

6.

With respect to Assignment #2, the Student hacked into the account of a fellow student Steven
Christie and copied the work that had been submitted by him on Assignment #2 and submitted
it as his own work. These events occuned between November 9, 2014 and November 10,
2014.

7.

During the hearing, we were presented with evidence from Professor Reid describing how
these events were uncovered. We also heard evidence from Maiiin Loeffler, the Director of
Information, Security, and Enterprise Architecture at the University of Toronto who described
the investigation that was conducted which formed the basis for establishing that the Student
had in fact hacked into the University's computer network and with specific details of the
exact time of entry and the exact activity that was the subject matter of the charge. The
evidence was quite overwhelming and it was not challenged by the Student.

DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
8.

Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, we had no difficulty concluding that the
offences had been made out by the University. Accordingly, we found the Student guilty on
Counts 1, 2, and 3 relating to the altering of his academic record on Assignment #1. The
University then withdrew Count 4. We also had no difficulty finding the Student guilty on
Counts 5, and 6. The University then withdrew Count 7.

SANCTIONS AND REASONS
9.

Following the finding of guilt on the Counts referred to above, the University and the Student,
through his counsel, provided the Tribunal with an Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint
Submission on Penalty.

10.

In the Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission on Penalty, it was acknowledged that
the Student has been suspended from the University under the Code of Student Conduct since
December 5, 2014. This suspension related to the incident referred to above involving the
Student gaining access to the University's computer system.

11.

In the Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission on Penalty, the Student agreed to
permanently withdraw from the University and not to seek admission or readmission to the
University at any time in the future.

12.

The Joint Submission on Penalty, proposed the following sanctions:
Joint Submission on Penalty:

5

5.

The Provost and Mr. ~ l submit that, in all the
circumstances of the case, the University Tribunal should
impose the following sanctions on M r . ~ :
(a)

a final grade of zero in the Course CSC 369;

(b)
a suspension from University from the date the
Tribunal makes its order until December 5, 2019; and
(c)
a permanent notation of the sanction on his
academic record and transcript
6.

13.

The pmiies submit that this case shall be reported to the
Provost for publication of a notice of the decision of the
Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the name of the
student withheld.

The Tribunal then heard the submissions of counsel for the University and the Student and we
were referred to a number of decisions dealing with the circumstances in which a Tribunal
should accept or reject a joint submissions on penalty.

14.

The basic principles are as follows:
(a)

The Tribunal is not obliged or required to accept a joint submission on penalty. The
Tribunal retains the obligation and responsibility to impose a fit sentence in the
circumstances of every case including those where a joint submission on penalty has
been proposed; 1

(b)

The companion obligation is that a joint submission on penalty may be rejected only in
circumstances where to give effect to it would be contrary to the public interest or
bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 2

(c)

A good expression of the test is that the Tribunal should only reject a joint submission
on penalty if it concludes that it is unreasonable or "unconscionable" for it to be
accepted. 3

Sheran Fernando above.

6

15.

The Tribunal concluded that it would accept the Joint Submission on Penalty based on these
principles.

16.

An important aspect of our decision was the Student's agreement to permanently withdraw
from the University and not seek admission or readmission to the University at any time in the
future.

ORDER

17.

Accordingly, the Tribunal makes the following order:
(a)

impose a final grade of zero in Course CSC 369;

(b)

a suspension from the University from the date the Tribunal makes its order until
December 5, 2019; and

(c)

a permanent notation of the sanction on the Student's academic record and transcript;

(d)

That this case should be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed with the name of the
Student withheld.

Dated at Toronto, this ~ y of December, 2015.

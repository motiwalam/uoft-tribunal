PRELIMINARY ISSUE OF NOTICE OF THE HEARING

1.

The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on April 3, 2007 to consider
charges under the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995
(the “Code”) laid against the “Student by letter dated April 5, 2006 from Professor Edith
Hillan, Vice Provost, Academic (the “Charges”).

2.

Thirty minutes after the time at which the hearing was scheduled to begin, the Student
had not appeared. The University proposed to proceed in the Student’s absence.

3.

The Tribunal heard submissions with respect to the University’s request to proceed in the
absence of the student.

4.

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the University sought directions from
Patricia S. Jackson, Senior Chair of the University Tribunal, concerning service. By
order dated February 15, 2007, the Senior Chair, after reviewing the various attempts by
the University to serve the Charges on the Student and the various attempts to schedule
the hearing, gave directions as follows:
(i)

The University may set a hearing date for any or all of April 2, 3, 5 and/or
10, 2007, or later dates as required, without further consultation with the
Student;

(ii)

The University shall advise the Student by e-mail and by courier of the
terms of this Direction no later than February 16, 2007;

(iii)

The Student shall have until February 28, 2007 to respond to the
University to indicate whether he will be available to attend the hearing
dates set by the University pursuant to paragraph 1 above;

(iv)

If the Student advises the University by February 28, 2007 that he will not
be in Toronto and therefore will not be available on any of the hearing
dates set pursuant to paragraph 1 above, the Student and the University
shall find four mutually agreeable alternate hearing dates to take place
before the end of May, 2007;

2

(v)

If the Student fails to respond to the University by February 28, 2007, or
to provide four alternate dates on which he can be available for a hearing
prior to the end of May 2007, the hearing dates set pursuant to paragraph 1
above will be pre-emptory to the Student and shall proceed as scheduled
provided that the University has served notice of the hearing fourteen days
in advance as permitted by this Direction;

(vi)

The University may serve documents to the Student by e-mail and regular
mail or courier; and

(vii)

Service of documents will be deemed effective seven days after the
documents are mailed or one day after they are delivered by e-mail or
courier.

5.

At the outset of hearing the panel heard the evidence that the Student had been served
with the Direction of the Tribunal by courier and by e-mail on February 16, 2007.

6.

The panel also heard the evidence that a revised Notice of Hearing was sent to the
Student by courier and e-mail on March 7, 2007 advising the Student that the hearing
would proceed on April 3, 2007 at 5:30 p.m., April 5, 2007 at 6:30 p.m. and April 10,
2007 at 5:30 p.m.

7.

After considering all the evidence and the Direction of the Tribunal, the panel concluded
that the Student had received reasonable notice of the hearing in accordance with the
provisions of the Code and of the Statutory Powers Procedures Act.

3

The panel

concluded that it was appropriate for the Tribunal to proceed in the absence of the
Student without any further notice of the proceeding.

8.

The panel then heard opening submissions from the University counsel and adjourned the
hearing to April 10, 2007 for the hearing of witnesses.

HEARING ON THE MERITS

9.

There are 84 charges in total involving 9 courses.

The Charges are attached as

Appendix A to these Reasons.

10.

The conduct that is the subject matter of the allegations took place over the period from
December 2002 to January 5, 2005. In total the charges relate to 21 separate assignments
in 9 courses.

In some cases there are multiple charges arising out of the same

assignments.

11.

In a nutshell, the evidence was that the Student enlisted the aid of two female students
(with some overlap) to assist him with respect to various assignments ranging from
course assignments to essays and, in some cases, exams. These female students had in
succession become his girlfriends. The assistance became so extensive that the “friends”
did virtually all the work on his various assignments with little or no work being done by
the Student himself. The evidence was that the “friends” actually attended the lectures on

4

behalf of the Student, wrote his assignments or essays from start to finish, and then
submitted them under his name.

12.

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, we were provided with lengthy affidavits of
the two “friends” setting out in great detail the work they had done on the various
courses. Their evidence was supported by numerous e-mail exchanges with the Student
that provided clear evidence that all the work for these various assignments was done by
the “friends” and not by the Student.

13.

The evidence was particularly disturbing because it was clear that, for whatever reason,
these “friends” were encouraged or pressured to help the Student and in the process they
were seriously manipulated by the Student. There is no indication that they received
benefits or that they were threatened into doing this work for the Student. Instead they
did it because of a misguided belief that they were helping him. Clearly, the evidence
showed that the Student had an uncanny ability to exert influence over these “friends”
and that he used this influence to have a free ride in these courses at their expense.

14.

The two “friends” were called as witnesses at the hearing on April 10, 2007. They each
confirmed that the evidence set out in their affidavits was true and they took the panel
through their affidavit and the documents referred to in the affidavits.

15.

During their testimony, the panel had the opportunity to see the “friends” and ask them
questions to test their credibility. Overall, the panel was satisfied that they were telling
the truth even though the truth is stranger than fiction.

5

16.

The two “friends” were the only live witnesses called by the University. In addition to
their affidavit evidence and their oral testimony the panel also admitted affidavit evidence
from the various professors or teaching assistants who taught their courses.
affidavits provided background to the course requirements.

These

In a few cases the

assignments that had been submitted by the Student were retained by the professor and
the panel was able to compare the work submitted with the work done by the “friends”.

17.

The affidavits of the professors and instructors which were admitted and considered by
the panel are as follows:
(a)

The Affidavit of Rick Guisso,
He is a professor of East-Asian Studies and the instructor in course EAS102Y1
and EAS437. His affidavit described the course requirements.

(b)

The Affidavit of Jingson Ma.
He was a teaching assistant in course EAS336H1H (Chinese literature). His
affidavit described the course requirements.

(c)

The Affidavit of Yu Chang.
He was the instructor in EAS204Y1. His affidavit described the course syllabus
and the various assignments in this course.

(d)

The Affidavit of George Zhao.
He was the instructor in course EAS203Y1. He attached to his evidence a copy of
the essay submitted by the Student in course EAS203Y entitled SARS and Its
Impact in the Chinese Economy and Society with the instructor’s handwritten

6

notes and the mark of 70. The evidence showed that this essay was identical to
the one prepared by one of the “friends”.
(e)

Affidavit of Chin Lim.
He was the instructor in HIS3A5. He attached to his affidavit a book report
submitted by the Student on November 11, 2003. This book report was identical
to the one prepared by one of the “friends”.

18.

The panel also admitted and considered two other affidavits:
(a)

The Affidavit of Andre Schmid.
He was the Chair of the Department of East-Asian Studies. When the allegations
arose, he communicated with the Student by e-mail. The e-mail exchange was
attached to his affidavit. In an e-mail of May 14, 2005, the Student wrote to
Professor Schmid and asked whether or not he would be penalized “for asking my
tutor and friends to edit my papers, to help me check grammar and to rephrase my
sentences where necessary, provided that whole ideas in my paper are my own. It
is because when you asked me if my papers are my own writing, I do not know
whether you mean if I plagiarized, or if anyone has helped me with my papers.”
Although the Student did not appear at the hearing, the panel considered this
possible explanation and questioned the “friends” concerning it.

They both

testified that the work was done by them and not by the Student.
(b)

The Affidavit of Kristi Gourly.
Ms. Gourly is the Manager, Office of Student Academic Conduct in the Faculty
of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto.

7

In that capacity she is

responsible for assisting the Dean’s Designates in investigating administrative
matters referred to the Dean’s Office. She attended a meeting with the Student on
August 18, 2005 to discuss the allegations that had been referred to the Dean’s
Office and which are the subject matter of this hearing. She was at the meeting
with the Dean’s Designate, David Smith, and others. The various courses in
question and the course work in question were discussed with the Student. He
denied that the work on these courses was done by others claiming that he had
done all of the work for the courses himself although he might have obtained
editing help for some assignments. In the course of this meeting, the Student was
not able to provide any meaningful answer concerning the actual coursework in
question. Specifically, one of the assignments in question was an essay on SARS.
The Student was not able to identify what that acronym referred to, nor could he
say what part of the body it affected. It was very clear in that meeting that the
Student had no idea what this essay was about. Similarly he had not recollection
of the subject matter of the book report submitted under his name.
19.

At the conclusion of the hearing the panel gave brief oral reasons for its conclusions
indicating that written reasons would follow.

The Details of the Charges
Course EAS102Y1 – Introduction to East-Asian Civilization – Counts 1 to 6
This was a full year course commencing in the fall of 2002. The evidences relates to two term
tests and a final exam. In advance of these tests and the exam the students were provided with
practice questions. The evidence of Friend 1 was that she prepared draft answers which the

8

Student would copy onto “cheat-sheets”. However, the panel concluded that the evidence was
inconclusive as to whether he did, in fact, use these “cheat-sheets” on the exam. Accordingly,
the panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence to register a conviction with respect to
any of the counts in relation to this course. Accordingly, the panel would dismiss the counts in
connection with this course.
Course EAS203Y1, China and the Internet – counts 7 through 17.

20.

This was a research-based course that focused on the Internet and required the students to
work relatively independently. Students were required to choose a topic, research that
topic and incorporate their findings into websites that they designed. The students were
also expected to make an in-class presentation and a final paper.

21.

The evidence of Friend 1 was that she researched, designed and created a webpage which
the Student submitted as the web-based project. She also wrote all of the research paper
that he submitted in this course. She also prepared the presentation that he gave and did
all of the other assignments in the course.

22.

One of the course assignments was to submit a list of sources the students intended to use
for the research paper, presentation and the website. Friend 1 chose the research topic
and did the research to find the source material. She prepared the e-mail to the professor
as required.

23.

She also prepared the assignment which was to provide an outline of the final research
paper. She did this without any involvement or input from the Student.

9

24.

She did all the work in the preparation of the research paper entitled “SARS: Its Impact
on the Chinese Economy and Society” which was worth 25% of the final mark. Professor
George Zhao actually retained a copy of this paper with his handwritten notes on it and
the final mark.

This was compared to the documents submitted as exhibits to the

affidavit of Friend 1 and they are identical. This provided corroboration for the evidence
of Friend 1 that she prepared the paper submitted by the Student. Her evidence was that
the Student did no work on this paper.

25.

The evidence of Friend 1 was that she also prepared the webpage related to the project
without any assistance or input from the Student.

26.

The charges relating to this course are contained in counts 7 through 17 of the Charges.

27.

Some of them are duplicative in a sense that they allege different offences for the same
misconduct. We feel it is appropriate that a conviction be entered on one count only
relating to each event of misconduct with the other charges being dismissed as
duplicative. Accordingly, the panel concluded that there should be a conviction on
counts 7, 10, 13, and 16. The other counts should be dismissed as duplicative.

Course AES336 – Chinese Literature Pre-Qin-Tang – Counts 18 to 27

28.

This course was taken in the fall of 2003.

29.

The evidence of Friend 1 was that the students were provided with practice essay
questions which would be part of the test. She prepared draft essay answers which she
10

sent to the Student. However, there is no clear and convincing evidence that he did, in
fact, use them on the test. We find that the evidence with respect to this particular
incident does not warrant a conviction. Accordingly, the panel would dismiss counts 18,
19 and 20.

30.

There was also a term test on November 18, 2003. Prior to the test the instructor
provided the class with three possible topics. By this point in time the Student was also
enlisting the aid of Friend 2. Friend 2 prepared answers to one of the questions. The
Student told Friend 2 that he would copy the answer onto a “cheat-sheet” that he would
take it into the test.

31.

When the Student attended the test on November 18, 2003, the essay question that Friend
2 had prepared for the Student was not on the test. The Student took the blank test
booklet and left the test-room so that he could use it to take the re-write. Friend 2
prepared answers to the other questions prior to a re-write which was scheduled for
November 24, 2003. Prior to the re-write, the Student came to the apartment of Friend 2
and wrote out the answer on the test booklet which he had taken from the room on
November 18, 2003. He then took the booklet with the answer prepared by Friend 2 to
the re-write on November 23, 2003.

32.

The panel would register a conviction on counts 23 and 24. The panel would dismiss the
counts 21 and 22 as duplicative.

11

33.

There was also a term paper due on December 2, 2003 worth 50% of the final grade.
Friend 2 prepared the term paper. The Student did not work on the paper. He submitted
it on December 2, 2003.

The panel would register a conviction on count 26 and dismiss the counts 25 and 27 as
duplicative.
Course EAS237Y – The Japanese Cinema(s): Film Form and the Problems of Modernity Counts 28 through 36

34.

In this course, the Student was expected to submit one-page comments on various
readings. In her affidavit, Friend 1 stated that she prepared and submitted the first
assignment on September 23, 2003 on behalf of the Student without any assistance from
him. She sent it to the Student and was told by him that he had submitted it as his own
work. Similarly, a second paper was submitted on November 4, 2003. Friend 1 prepared
the assignment for the Student. He told her that he submitted the document as his own
work. The Student did not do any work on these assignments.

35.

A term paper was to be submitted on November 11, 2003. It was worth 20% of the final
mark. Friend 1 prepared the term paper for the Student. He told her that he handed it in
as his own work. The Student did not do any work or provide any input into the paper.

36.

Accordingly, the panel concludes that there should be a finding of guilt with respect to
the two assignments and the term paper in this course. The specific charges in respect of

12

which we would register a conviction are counts 29, 32 and 35. The other counts will be
dismissed as duplicative.

Course HIS385Y1 – History of Hong Kong – Counts 37 to 39
37.

This course was taken in the fall of 2003 and was taught by professor Chin Lim.

38.

As part of the course work, the Student was required to submit a book report worth 20%
of the mark.

39.

Friend 1 did some of the work with respect to this book report. Friend 2 also worked on
this assignment. The Student did not do any work on this book report. The Student
submitted the book report as his own.

40.

The evidence of Friend 1 was that she prepared most of the book report. She edited some
of the report and prepared the bibliography and cover page.

41.

Friend 2 also had some involvement in the preparation of this book report. Segments of
the book report were prepared by her. The Student sent these segments to Friend 1 for
editing and inclusion into the final report. Apparently, the Student was taking work from
both Friend 1 and Friend 2 at the same time.

42.

Professor Chin Lim submitted an affidavit attaching a copy of the book report submitted
by the Student. The book report in the professor’s file was identical to that on the

13

computer of Friend 1, thereby corroborating her testimony that her work was submitted
by the Student as his own.
43.

The panel would register a conviction on count 38 and it would dismiss counts 37 and 39
as duplicative.

Course EAS334Y1 – The Chinese Novel – Counts 40 to 42

44.

One of the course requirements for this course was a test. In the case of test number 5,
the professor provided the questions prior to the test. The evidence of Friend 2 was that
she prepared the answer for the Student. He told her that he would be copying it onto
some form of “cheat-sheet” for use during the test. She testified that she sat beside the
Student during the test and observed that he was using the “cheat-sheet” in the course of
writing the test.

45.

The panel would register a conviction on count 42. We would dismiss counts 40 and 41
and duplicative.

Course EAS437Y – Independent Study – Counts 43 to 47

46.

The entire grade for this course was based on an essay. The Student had to provide a
bibliography and an outline of the essay prior to submitting it. The evidence of Friend 2
was that she prepared the essay that was submitted by the Student without any
independent work being done by the Student. She also did all the course work for this
assignment.

14

47.

The panel would register a conviction on count 43 in relation to the course work and
count 46 in connection with the essay. The other charges will be dismissed as duplicative.

Course EAS204Y – Approach to the Modern East Asian History – Counts 48 to 52

48.

This course was taken in the fall of 2004. It was a full credit course.

49.

The evidence of Friend 2 is that she did the work for the Student on this course in the fall
of 2004, but she did not do any work in 2005 as they had broken up by that point.

50.

One of the course requirements was an essay for submission on November 11, 2004. The
evidence of Friend 2 was that she did all the work for the paper. The Student submitted it
as his own work. He did not do any work on the essay. She also testified that after he
received the paper back with a mark of 60%, he told her that he was upset with this grade
and told her that she “had not done very well”.

51.

Friend 2 also gave evidence with respect to some assistance she provided to the Student
in preparing answers to the questions that were provided in advance of the Christmas
exam. She prepared a written essay answer to two questions. The Student told her that
he would be copying it on to “cheat-sheets”. The evidence was not very clear as to
whether he did use these “cheat-sheets” or not. Overall on this part of the Charges, the
panel concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to register convictions.

15

52.

The panel will register a conviction on count 49 which relates to the essay. It would
dismiss counts 48 and 50 as duplicative. The panel would dismiss counts 51 and 52
relating to cheating on the exam as there is insufficient evidence to support these counts.

Course JMC301 – Approaches to Modern East Asian History – Counts 53 to 57
53.

This was a full credit course commencing in the fall of 2004.

54.

The first set of allegations in connection with this course relate to the work done on a
term test in the fall of 2004. The evidence was that the instructor provided a hand-out
with preparation questions. The Student had obtained draft answers from other students
in the course and asked Friend 2 to edit them so they would not appear to be the same.
He told her that he would be putting the revised answers onto a “cheat-sheet”. There was
no clear evidence that he did, in fact, do this. Accordingly, the panel concluded that there
was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on this allegation.

Accordingly, the

panel would dismiss counts 53 and 54.
55.

Another course requirement was submission of an essay due on January 5, 2005 worth
25% of the final grade.

56.

The evidence of Friend 2 was that she wrote the essay and that the Student did not work
on it. The Student submitted the essay on January 25, 2005 as his own work.

57.

The panel would register a conviction on count 56 and dismiss counts 55 and 57 as
duplicative.

16

THE PENALTY
58.

59.

The University submitted that the appropriate penalty in the circumstances is as follows:

(a)

A recommendation to the President of the University of Toronto that the Student
be expelled from the University;

(b)

That there be a mark of zero in each course; and

(c)

That the report of the decision be made to the Provost for publication in the
University newspapers with the Student’s name withheld.

(d)

In the alternative, in the event that the University does not accept the
recommendation of the expulsion, that the Student be suspended for the period of
5 years.

The accepted guidelines for determining the appropriate sanction are as follows:
(a)

The character of the person charged;

(b)

The likelihood of a repetition of the offence;

(c)

The nature of the offence committed;

(d)

Any extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;

(e)

The detriment to the University occasioned by the offence;

(f)

The need to deter others from the committing a similar offence.

60.

The panel concluded that it was appropriate in this case to recommend expulsion.

61.

This case involves a pattern of conduct showing complete disregard for the basic ethical
principles upon which the University community rests. There was submission of work
17

that was not authored by the Student, that was not the Student’s original work and that
was entirely the work of others.

There was evidence of cheating on tests and

assignments. There was a pattern of deliberate dishonest and manipulative conduct. This
involved not only violations of the University’s practices and procedures, but also
involved the manipulation of two students that the Student used to assist him in his
scheme. This dishonesty and manipulation took place over a number of years and
involved a number of courses.

62.

There was no evidence of any extenuating circumstances. No evidence was presented by
the Student to rebut the evidence of the “friends”. The Student did not participate in the
Tribunal process. In fact, there was evidence that he was intentionally evading service,
and otherwise avoiding his responsibilities as a member of the University community.
When initially confronted with the allegations at a meeting with the Dean’s Designate he
perpetuated his dishonesty by providing false explanations for his dishonest conduct. He
showed no understanding of his wrongdoing.

63.

It is very troubling that the Student made such extraordinary efforts to find ways to
circumvent the rules of the University. He showed a pattern of deliberate disregard for
University’s basic rules of ethical conduct.

64.

The number of courses and assignments involved in the elaborate planning that went into
the implementation of the Student’s dishonest scheme is overwhelming. The panel could
think of no good reason to impose anything but the most severe penalty.

18

65.

Taking all these factors into the account, the panel concluded that the appropriate penalty
is:
(a)

A recommendation to the Governing Council for the Student’s expulsion from the
University of Toronto;

(b)

The Student will be assigned the mark of zero in the following courses: HIS385,
EAS203, EAS336, EAS437, EAS334, EAS204, EAS237, JMC301; and

(c)

There will be a publication of the sanction and decision in the University
publication with the name of the Student withheld.

(d)

In the alternative, in the event that the recommendation of expulsion is not
accepted, that the Student be suspended for a period of five years.

   Not in Attendance: The Student

   TheÂ StudentÂ was charged under s. B.i.3(a)Â of theâ¯Code of Behaviour
   on Academic Matters, 1995â¯(âCodeâ)Â on the basis
   thatÂ theÂ StudentÂ knowinglyÂ forged,Â or in any other way
   altered,Â or falsified a document or evidence required by the
   University of Toronto, or uttered, circulated or made use of such
   forged, altered or falsified document, namely aÂ DegreeÂ purportedly
   from the University of Toronto.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of
   theâ¯Studentâ¯appeared at the hearing.â¯OnÂ reading the affidavit of
   service and theÂ affidavit ofÂ Counselâs assistant,Â andÂ in
   consideration of theÂ Policy on Official Correspondence with
   StudentsÂ (âPolicyâ)Â andÂ Rules 9 and 17 ofÂ theÂ Rules of Practice
   and ProcedureÂ (âRulesâ) of the University Tribunal, the Panel was
   satisfied that theÂ StudentÂ was served with the ChargesÂ andÂ the
   Notice of Electronic Hearing.Â The Panel noted that actual notice is
   not required under the Rules and serviceÂ can beÂ effectedÂ by sending
   the notice to the email address listed in ROSI. As per the Policy,
   students are expected to monitor and retrieve emails. The Panel
   therefore noted that the UniversityÂ satisfied the services
   requirements as set out in the Rules.Â The PanelÂ ordered that the
   hearing proceed in theÂ StudentâsÂ absence.

   TheÂ PanelÂ consideredÂ affidavitÂ evidenceÂ submitted on behalf of the
   University.Â TheÂ evidenceÂ outlinedÂ that Rotman Commerce received an
   email fromÂ an employee background check and due diligence
   service,Â Quanren,Â asking to verify information pertaining
   toÂ theÂ StudentâsÂ degree completion status at the University of
   Toronto. The email attached an electronic copy of a degree which
   contained theÂ StudentâsÂ name and indicated that they had obtained a
   Bachelor of Commerce from the University in 2014.Â In consideringÂ all
   ofÂ the affidavit evidence,Â the Panel acceptedÂ that the name, date of
   birth, and course of study (commerce) identifiedÂ in the email
   fromÂ QuanrenÂ (âQuanrenÂ emailâ)Â match those of theÂ StudentÂ and
   that the Degree was forged as theÂ StudentÂ did not graduate from the
   University.

   The Panel noted that while thereÂ wereÂ other students
   inÂ theÂ Universityâs Repository ofÂ Student Information (âROSIâ) with
   the same name, no other student with the same name hadÂ a birth
   dateÂ that matchedÂ the date of birthÂ identified in
   theÂ QuanrenÂ email. The one identifying characteristic that didÂ not
   matchÂ wasÂ gender; the gender identified in ROSIÂ wasÂ femaleÂ and
   theÂ genderÂ identified in theÂ QuanrenÂ emailÂ wasÂ male.Â The
   PanelÂ noted thatÂ theÂ evidence beforeÂ itÂ establishes that
   theÂ StudentÂ is the only individual with both the name and birth date
   identified in theÂ QuanrenÂ email. The Panel further noted that unlike
   gender, a birth date is immutable. Therefore, the Panel was satisfied
   on a balance ofÂ probabilities that theÂ StudentÂ is the individual
   identified in theÂ QuanrenÂ email.Â Â Based onÂ all the evidence, the
   Panel entered a finding of guiltÂ under s. B.i.3(a) of the Code
   forÂ forging or in any other way altering or falsifying an academic
   record, and/or uttering, circulatingÂ or making use of such forged,
   altered or falsified record.

   In determining sanction, the PanelÂ considered the principles and
   factors relevant to sanction discussed inÂ University of Toronto and
   Mr. C.Â (âMr. C. factorsâ).Â With respect to theÂ StudentâsÂ character,
   extenuating circumstances and the likelihood to reoffence, the Panel
   noted that theÂ StudentÂ did notÂ participateÂ in the academic
   discipline process or in the proceeding. TheÂ StudentÂ didÂ not have
   anyÂ prior offencesÂ but did engage in deliberate dishonesty.Â
   ThereÂ wasÂ no evidence before the Panel of character, extenuating
   circumstances or remorse. The Panel found that theÂ StudentÂ exhibited
   dishonesty and unethical characterÂ andÂ in light ofÂ these factors,
   the Panel noted that there is a likelihood of repetition of the
   offence.Â With respect to the nature of the offence, the detriment to
   the University and general deterrence, the Panel noted that these
   factors overlap. They further noted thatÂ forgery of an academic record
   is one ofÂ the most serious offences a student can commitÂ as
   outlinedÂ inÂ University of Toronto v. J.R.Â (Case No. 1018, November
   26, 2019) atÂ paragraph 19.Â The importance of maintaining the
   integrity of the Universityâs academic records and deterring students
   from engaging in forgery of degree certificates cannot be
   overemphasized.

   Upon review of the relevant case law and the Mr. C. factors, the Panel
   accepted the sanction proposed by the University. The Panel imposed the
   following sanctions:Â a five-year suspensionÂ or until Governing
   Council makesÂ itsÂ decision on expulsion, whichever comes first;Â a
   correspondingÂ notationÂ on the transcript;Â recommendation that
   theÂ StudentÂ be expelled, as per s.Â C.ii.(b)(i) of Code; report to
   Provost for publication.

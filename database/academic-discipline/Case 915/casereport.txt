Introduction

F

(the

"Student").

The Charge
2.

The charges against the Student (the "Charges") are as follows:
(a)

You knowingly forged or in any other way altered or falsified an academic
record, and/or uttered, circulated or made use of such forged, altered or
falsified record, namely, a document which purported to be your Transcript
of Consolidated Academic Record from the University of Toronto dated
June 3, 2015, contrary to section B. l.3(a) of the Code.

(b)

In the alternative, you knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic
dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise
described in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage
of any kind, contrary to Section B.l.3(b) of the Code.

Particulars

3.

The particulars of the offences charged are as follows:
(a)

As part of your admission to York University you provided a document that
purported to be your Transcript of Consolidated Academic Record from
the University of Toronto dated May 17, 2016.

(b)

You forged this document and falsely represented your marks, grades,
sessional grade point averages, cumulative grade point averages, and
academic history and status.

(c)

You knew that this document was forged, altered, and/or falsified when
you circulated it.

(d)

You had an obligation to provide accurate and truthful information and not
to misrepresent your academic record. You had an obligation not to
provide forged or falsified documents in support of your application.

3

Process
4.

The Student did not appear at the hearing. Counsel for the University applied for

an order that the hearing proceed in the absence of the Student.

5.

Counsel for the University submitted the following evidence of the service and

attempted service of notice of the Charge and of the hearing upon the Student:

(a)

The Notice of Hearing, together with an affidavit of service in which Ms.
Krista Osbourne affirmed that she served the Notice of Hearing on the
Student by email at the email address he had provided to the University of
Toronto in ROSI, and had attempted to serve the Student by courier at the
address he had provided to the University in ROSI, in each case on
February 14, 2017;

(b)

The Charges, together with an affidavit of service of Ms. Susan Murphy in
which she swore that she served the Student with the Charges by email at
the email address he had provided to the University in ROSI on January
17, 2017;and

(c)

An email to Counsel from Mark Wiseman, Acting Director, Information
Security, Information Technology Services, in which Mr. Wiseman
confirmed to Counsel that the last time the email mailbox of the Student
provided to the University in ROSI was accessed was March 5, 2017,
being after the service by email of the Charges and the Notice of Hearing
as indicated above.

6.

Counsel for the University relied upon sections 9 and 17 of the Rules of Practice

and Procedure of the University (the "Rules") and upon sections 6 and 7 of the Statutory
Powers Procedure Act (Ontario) as authority for the Tribunal to proceed in the absence
of the Student, in light of the service and attempted service upon the Student as reflected
in the evidence.

7.

The Panel was satisfied that it was entitled to proceed in the absence of the

Student and issued an order to that effect.

4

The Evidence
8.

Counsel for the University focused on the first charge, that the Student knowingly

forged or in any other way altered or falsified an academic record, and/or uttered,
circulated or made use of such forged, altered or falsified record, namely, a document
which purported to be the Student's Transcript of Consolidated Academic Record from
the University of Toronto dated June 3, 2015, contrary to section B.l.3(a) of the Code.

9.

The Panel heard evidence from Ms. Kawar, Manager at the University of Toronto

Transcript Centre in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Ms. Kawar is one of four employees
at the Transcript Centre, which provides services to students upon their request, including
issuing transcripts. Ms. Kawar often receives calls from institutions seeking to verify a
record, particularly if the record was provided to the student rather than directly to the
institution.

10.

Ms. Kawar gave evidence that she received an email on September 19, 2016 from

Ms. Cousins, her counterpart at York University, seeking to verify a purported transcript
(the "challenged transcript") that had been provided to York University by the Student.
Ms. Kawar then retrieved the Student's actual academic record from ROSI and compared
it to the challenged transcript received from Ms. Cousins. The Panel was presented with
the challenged transcript along with a copy of the Student's official transcript as issued by
the Transcript Centre.

11.

The Student's registration history, student number, date of birth and Ontario

Education Number appearing on the challenged transcript were identical to his actual
academic record. However, more courses and sessions appeared on the challenged
transcript than the actual record, and the grades, sessional grade point averages and
cumulative grade point average appearing on the challenged transcript did not reflect the
Student's actual academic record. In particular, the challenged transcript presented more
courses, and higher grades and GPAs, than the Student's actual transcript. Ms. Kawar
gave evidence that no student at the University had an academic record that "matched"
the courses and grades reflected on the challenged transcript.

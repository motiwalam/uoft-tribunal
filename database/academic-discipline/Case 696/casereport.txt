REASONS FOR DECISION

1.

The Trial Division of the University of Toronto Tribunal was convened on

August 19, 2013 to consider charges advanced by the University of Toronto (the
"University") against ~ ~ (the "Student") under the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters (the "Code").
The Charges

2.

The Student is charged with four offences under the Code:
(1)

In November 2011, you knowingly forged or in any other way

altered or falsified a document or evidence required by the University of
Toronto, or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or
falsified document, namely, a University of Toronto Student Medical
Certificate, dated November 18, 2011 , which you submitted in support of
your request for academic accommodations or relief in PSY280, contrary
to Section B.1.1 (a) of the Code.
(2)

In February 2012, you knowingly forged or in any other way altered

or falsified a document or evidence required by the University of Toronto,
or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or falsified
document, namely, a University of Toronto Student Medical Certificate,
dated February 3, 2012, which you submitted in support of your request
for academic accommodations in PSY252, contrary to Section B.1.1 (a) of
the Code.
(3) In June 2012, you knowingly forged or in any other way altered or
falsified a document or evidence required by the University of Toronto, or
uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged , altered or falsified
document, namely, a University of Toronto Student Medical Certificate,
dated June 20, 2012, which you submitted in support in support of your
2

request for academic accommodations in PSY321, contrary to Section
B.1.1 (a) of the Code.
(4) In the alternative to each of the charges above, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
or misrepresentation not otherwise described in order to obtain academic
credit or other academic advantage of any kind by submitting fal'sified or
forged documents to the University of Toronto in support of various forms
of academic accommodation or relief, contrary to Section B.l.3(b) of the
Code.
Agreed Statement of Facts and Plea

2.

At the outset of the hearing, Discipline Counsel advised that the University

and the Student had entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts. The Agreed
Statement of Facts is attached hereto as Appendix "A".
3.

Pursuant to the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student pied guilty to

charges (1)-(3) listed above. Discipline Counsel advised that if the Tribunal
accepted the plea on the first three charges then the University withdrew charge
(4).
4.

The Student was in attendance and confirmed that she pied guilty to the

charges as provided for in the Agreed Statement of Facts.
5.

The details of the charges are set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts

and are supported by the documents contained in the Joint Book of Documents.
The charges relate to three petitions filed by the student for academic

3

accommodation on the basis of medical illness. The essential elements of the
charges are set out below.
The First Petition

6.

The first charge relates to a petition filed by the Student in November 2011

in PSY 280. The Student petitioned the Department of Psychology for academic
accommodation for a test she missed on November 18, 2011. The test the
Student missed was worth 23% of the final grade in PSY 280.
7.

In support of this petition, the Student submitted a University of Toronto

Student Medical Certificate, which was purportedly signed by Dr. Nafissa Aptikar
on November 18, 2011 (the "November 18 Certificate").
8.

Without verifying its authenticity, the University accepted the November 18

Certificate and granted the Student's petition for academic accommodation.
9.

The Student admits that she knowingly forged and falsified the November

18 Certificate. The November 18 Certificate was not prepared or signed by Dr.
Nafissa Aptikar.
The Second Petition

10.

The second charge relates to a petition filed by the Student in February

2012 in PSY 252. The Student petitioned the Department of Psychology for
academic accommodation for a test that she missed on February 3, 2012. The
test the Student missed was worth 28% of the grade in PSY 252.

4

11.

In support of this petition, the Student submitted a University of Toronto

Student Medical Certificate, which was purportedly signed by Dr. Nafissa Aptikar
on February 3, 2012 ("February 3 Certificate").
12.

Without verifying its authenticity, the University accepted the February 3

Certificate and granted the Student's petition for academic accommodation.
13.

The Student admits that she knowingly forged and falsified the February 3

Certificate. The February 3 Certificate was not prepared or signed by Dr. Nafissa
Aptikar.
The Third Petition

14.

The third charge relates to a petition filed by the Student in June 2012 in

PSY 321. The Student petitioned the Department of Psychology for academic
accommodation for an assignment she had not handed in due on or about June
20, 2012. The assignment was worth 25% of the final grade in PSY 321.
15.

In support of her petition, the Student submitted a University of Toronto

Student Medical Certificate dated June 20, 2012, which was purportedly
prepared and signed by Dr. Joanne Dunstall ("June 20 Certificate").
16.

Without verifying its authenticity, the University accepted the June 20

Certificate and granted the Student's petition for academic accommodation.

5

17.

The Student admits that she knowingly forged and falsified the June 20

Certificate. The June 20 Certificate was not prepared or signed by Dr. Joanne
Dunstall.
Decision on Charges

18.

The Tribunal reviewed the Agreed Statement of Facts, the documents in

support thereof and considered the submissions of Discipline Counsel. After
deliberating, the Tribunal determined that the facts proved charges 1-3 and
accepted the guilty plea entered into by the Student.
19.

As a result, the University withdrew charge 4. The Tribunal makes no

findings or determinations with respect to this charge.
Penalty

20.

The University and the Student submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty.

The Joint Submission on Penalty is attached to these reasons as Appendix "B".
The Joint Submission on Penalty proposed the following:
(a)

Assign to the Student a final grade of zero for each of: PSY 280,
PSY 252 and PSY 321;

(b)

suspend the Student from the University from the date of the order
of the Tribunal until May 31, 2018; and

(c)

place a notation on the Student's academic record and transcript
for a period of five years from the date of the order.
6

21. In oral submissions, Discipline Counsel emphasized that the seriousness of
the offences as they reflect repeated acts of dishonesty by the Student to gain an
advantage over her peers. He noted that this penalty is consistent with prior
Tribunal decisions on similar offences.
22.

Discipline Counsel referred the Tribunal to the two cases in which

students were charged with and plead guilty to falsifying multiple petitions for
academic accommodation. In both cases, the students received final grades of
zero in the relevant courses, five-year suspensions and notations on their
academic record and transcript for a five-year period (The University of Toronto
v. ~ ~ [ C a s e 642; June 10, 2011]; The University of

viaÂ£Case 633; March 22, 2012] ).
23.

Discipline Counsel noted that the proposed suspension in this case is

slightly less than five years because the Student has met all requirements for
graduation and will be eligible to graduate immediately following the suspension,
being June 2018. If the suspension were a full five years it would delay the
Student's graduation and , hence the practical effect of the penalty, for more than
five years.
23.

On behalf of the Student, Ms. Neumann submitted that the Student's

cooperation throughout the process was a mitigating factor. Ms. Neumann also
submitted documentation of the Student's significant learning disability, wh ich
she submitted was another mitigating factor on penalty.

7

00000000000~00--~--------------------------

24.

The Tribunal is mindful that there is a high threshold for rejecting a Joint

Submission on Penalty. To reject a Joint Submission on Penalty, the Tribunal
would have to hold that accepting the Joint Submission on Penalty would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute. This is not such a case.
25.

The offences to which the Student has admitted are very serious.

Submitting even one false petition would be a significant act of dishonesty and a
serious breach of trust. The Student has admitted to submitting three false
petitions in three different courses. In doing so, the Student sought to obtain an
academic advantage on three separate occasions to the detriment of her fellow
students and of the University.
26. The Penalty is fully in line with the precedents for similar types of offenses,
which led to almost identical penalties. The fact that the penalty is slightly under
five years to permit the Student to graduate in June 2018 is warranted in the
circumstances. The Student will have a notation on her academic record and
transcript for a full five-year period.
27. Finally, the mitigating factors in this case further support the reasonableness
of the penalty. The Student cooperated throughout this process, from the very
first allegation to this Tribunal hearing. She has accepted responsibility for her
acts, and although her learning disability was raised as another mitigating factor
on penalty, it was not relied upon to excuse the underlying offences.
28. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Joint Submission on Penalty is
reasonable in view of all of the circumstances of the case, and does not bring the
8

~-.-~~=---==~---------------administration of justice into disrepute. The Tribunal accepts the Joint
Submission on Penalty.

The Tribunal's order to this effect is attached as

Appendix "C".

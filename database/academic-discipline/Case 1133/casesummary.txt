   The Student was charged underÂ s. B.i.1(d) of theâ¯Code of Behaviour on
   Academic Matters, 1995â¯(the âCodeâ) on the basis thatÂ the
   StudentÂ knowinglyÂ represented as her own an idea or expression of an
   idea or work of another inÂ aÂ final exam. In the alternative, the
   Student was charged underÂ s.Â B.i.1(b)Â of theÂ CodeÂ on the basis
   that the StudentÂ knowinglyÂ obtained unauthorized assistance in
   connection withÂ aÂ final exam. In the further alternative, the Student
   was charged under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code on the basis that the Student
   knowinglyÂ engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or
   misconduct,Â fraudÂ or misrepresentation in order to obtain academic
   credit or other academic advantageÂ in connection with a final exam.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of the Student appeared
   at the hearing.â¯The Panel noted that s.Â 6 of theÂ Statutory Powers
   Procedure ActÂ (âSPPAâ) requires reasonable notice of the hearing be
   provided to the parties. Furthermore, rule 9 of the University
   TribunalÂ Rules of Practice and ProcedureÂ (âRulesâ)Â provides
   forÂ theÂ various methods of serviceÂ for documents including the
   charges and notice of hearing.Â The Panel noted that these methods
   includeÂ personal service, courierÂ toÂ the studentâsÂ mailing
   address,Â or viaÂ email toÂ theirÂ email address as recorded
   inÂ theÂ Repository of Student Information (âROSIâ).Â The Panel further
   noted that theÂ UniversityâsÂ Policy on Official Correspondence with
   StudentsÂ provides that students are responsible
   forÂ providingÂ current contact information in ROSIÂ and are expected
   toÂ monitor and retrieve all mail, including emails, on a frequent and
   consistent basis.Â The Panel consideredÂ s.Â 7 of the SPPA and rule
   17Â of the RulesÂ which allow the Tribunal to proceed in the absence of
   a student where noticeÂ has been given.Â The Panel noted thatÂ when
   proceeding in the absence of a student, the University must demonstrate
   it took reasonable steps to notifyÂ aÂ student of the charges and of
   the hearing. The University does not need to prove actual notice.Â The
   UniversityÂ provided evidence that the Student had been served
   atÂ herÂ ROSI-listed email address with theâ¯chargesâ¯andÂ theÂ notice
   of hearing.Â Theâ¯Studentâ¯was subsequently provided an opportunity to
   provide submissions in relation to theÂ form of the
   proceeding.Â Theâ¯Studentâ¯did notÂ respond,Â and the hearing was
   ordered to proceed electronically.â¯Furthermore, theÂ University
   provided evidence thatÂ Assistant DisciplineÂ CounselâsÂ legal
   assistantÂ called the phone number that the Student provided in ROSI
   and the Student answered. SheÂ advised the StudentÂ of the hearing date
   and askedÂ the StudentÂ to check herÂ University of TorontoÂ email. The
   Student advised she would check her email.Â The University further
   provided evidence that the Student had not accessed her emailÂ since
   September 2020, before any of the documents were served by email. Based
   on theÂ foregoing, the Panel found that the University took reasonable
   steps to notify the Student of the charges and theÂ hearing
   andÂ proceeded to hear the case on its merits in the Studentâs absence.

   Regarding the charges laid under s.Â B.i.1(d)Â of theÂ Code,
   theÂ PanelÂ received testimonial evidence ofÂ anÂ Assistant Professor
   who was theÂ course coordinator ofÂ the courseÂ for which the final
   exam in question was submitted.Â TheÂ AssistantÂ ProfessorÂ testified
   that Chegg.com is a subscription-based website that allows students to
   post problems, which are then answeredÂ byÂ so-called âexperts.â He
   further testified that instructors and teaching assistants foundÂ a
   number ofÂ the final exam questions posted on Chegg.comÂ along
   withÂ modelÂ answers to the questions.Â The Assistant Professor
   testified thatÂ the Studentâs exam containedÂ answers to various
   questions that were substantiallyÂ similar toÂ the answers found on
   Chegg.com.Â HeÂ furtherÂ testified that while some of the answers were
   correct, the solution sets took the same steps set out in the answers
   posted on Chegg.com.Â Furthermore, the incorrect answers contained the
   same errors as the answers posted to Chegg.com. The Panel noted that
   the Assistant Professor explained in his testimony that while
   thereÂ wereÂ multiple ways to solve each problem, it
   wouldÂ haveÂ beenÂ incredibly unlikely for each step to match exactly
   line by line.Â The Panel noted that the onus is on the University to
   establish on a balance of probabilities, using clear and convincing
   evidence, that the Student committed the academic offence. Upon review
   of the handwritten answers provided by the Student and
   theÂ handwrittenÂ answers on Chegg.com, it concluded that the Student
   was not the author of the answers posted on Chegg.com.Â The Panel
   concluded that the University established that the Student copied the
   answers from Chegg.com andÂ was guilty of academic misconductÂ as
   outlined in s.Â B.i.1(d) of the Code. Given the Panelâs findings, the
   University withdrew the alternativeÂ charges.

   In determining sanction,â¯the Panel consideredÂ the factorsÂ outlined
   inÂ University of Toronto and Mr. C.Â (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5,
   1976).Â Furthermore, the Panel consideredÂ various cases submitted
   byÂ Assistant DisciplineÂ CounselÂ that were consistent with the
   offence committed by the Student.Â After consideration of these cases,
   the Panel ordered theÂ penaltyÂ soughtÂ by the University.
   However,Â the PanelÂ ordered that the suspension run concurrentlyÂ with
   the StudentâsÂ currentÂ academic suspension.Â The Panel noted
   thatÂ there was no evidence before it on which it could conclude that
   the Student purchased the Chegg.com subscription, however, the Panel
   found that the Student intended to and did access Chegg.com.
   Furthermore, the Panel noted that the Student chose not to participate
   in the hearing and toÂ forgo her opportunity to provide evidenceÂ in an
   attempt toÂ mitigate the penalty.Â The Panel further noted that it was
   mindful of the fact that these events occurred during the Covid-19
   pandemic and that the Student was a foreign student.Â In imposing the
   penalty, the Panel noted that the penalty sought was not at the high
   end of the range, and,Â in light ofÂ the surrounding
   circumstances,Â the Panel feltÂ it was appropriate.Â The
   PanelÂ imposedÂ the following sanctions:Â a final grade of zero in the
   course;Â aÂ two-yearÂ suspensionÂ to run concurrently with the
   Studentâs academic suspension;Â aÂ three-yearÂ notation on transcript;
   andÂ aÂ report to the Provost for publication.

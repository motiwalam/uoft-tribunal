Preliminary Matters: Notice and Joint Hearing

[ 1] The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on November 23,
2010, to consider charges under the University of Toronto Code ofBehaviour on
Academic At/alters, 1995 (the Code) laid against two students by letters dated
July 19 and October 5, 2010.
[2] Mr. W was represented by Daniel Goldbloom, a Jaw student from Downtown
Legal Services. Ms. L
did not attend, nor was she represented at the
hearing. Lily Harmer, Assistant Discipline Counsel, advised the Tribunal that
Ms. L. . was pl'eviously represented by CLASP, a student legal aid cJinic at
Osgoode Hall Law School.
[3] However, Ms. Harmer introduced an Agreed Statement of Facts, signed by both
Mt·. W and Ms. L
, in which the two students acknowledged that they are
married to each other. As part of the Agreed Book of Documents, notices were
filed that had been sent to Ms. L
advising he1· of the hearing dates. Fm1her,
Mr. Goldbloom confirmed that his client, Mr. W , had taken the Agreed
Statement of Facts home and had advised Mr. Goldbloom that it had been
executed by his wife, Ms. L
. Further, Mr. Goldbloom confirmed that he had
also seen other documents showing that Ms. L
had received notice, as they
were documents that only she could have received. The Agreed Statement of
Facts also contained a consent by Ms. L;
that the matter proceed in her
absence.
[4] Ms. Harmer also reviewed the Notice ofHearing, which h1fonned Ms. L
that, if she did not attend, the hearing "may take place without you and you will
not be entitled to further notice in the proceeding". Ms. Harmer also refetTed the
Panel to sections 6 and 7 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, which permits
administrative tribunals to proceed in the absence of a party, provided prope1·
notice has been given.
[5] In light of the submissions of counsel and thefr reptesentations, as well as the
signed Agreed Statement of Facts before us, together with the admissions, notice
and consent to proceed in the absence of Ms. L.
, the panel was satisfied that
Ms. L. . was properly notified of the hearing and permitted the hearing to
proceed.
[6] A further preliminary matter related to whether the two cases could be heard
together. Ms. Harmer noted that Mr. W and Ms. L
consented to the matter
being heard together in paragraph 5 of the Agreed Statement of Facts. She also
drew our attention to section 9.1 of the SPPA which also petmitted the matters

-3-

to be heard together, with consent of the parties. Accordingly, the panel was
satisfied that the two cases should proceed together.

Agreed Statement of Facts and Admissions

[15] An Agreed Statement of Facts ("ASF") was filed at the hearing, signed by Mr.
W and Ms. L
. As noted in the ASF, Mr. W and Ms. L
waived
reading of the charges and although a Dean's Meeting was held with respect to
the first sets of charges (the December 4, 2009 matters), Mr. W and Ms. L
each waived their right to attend a meeting with the Dean with respect to the
second sets of charges (see paragraph 18 of the ASF).
[16] In the Agreement Statement of Facts, Mr. W pleaded guilty, as follows:

[17] Ms, L

(a)

to charges 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first set of charges; and

(b)

to chm·ges 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the second set of charges.

pleaded guilty as follows:
(c)

to charges 1 and 2 of the first set of charges; and

(d)

to charges 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, LO and 12 of the second set of

charges.
(18] The panel heard helpful submissions from counsel in su1mnarizing the charges,

and after taking time to review the ASF and two volumes of documents filed in
support of it, was satisfied on the basis of the evidence and the students'
admissions of guilt, that convictions should be registered on all charges to which
the students pleaded guilty. The University then withdrew the remaining
charges.
Summa1y of the Facts

First Sets of Charges: Events of December 4, 2009
[19] In the winter of 2009, Ms. L
was enrolled in ECMC92H3: Economics of
Markets and Pricing. A final exam, worth 60% of the overall course mark, was
scheduled to be written during the April 2009 exam period, Ms. L
obtained
permission to write a deferred exam in August, 2009, and then 1·eceived
permission to fmther defer the exam until December 4, 2009.
[20] On December 4, 2009, Mr. W p1·esented himself at the final exam and signed in
using the name ofH
L
. He presented an Ontario driver's licence
beating the name H.
1
, with her bhth date, but containing a
.photograph of himself. When asked by the exam invigilator for his U of T
student card. Mr. W stated that he did not have one and was sent to the library
to obtain one. At the library, Mr. W presented the fol'ged drive1·'s licence and,

- 16 -

on that basis, was issued a student card bearing the name H
L
. He
returned to the examination room and presented the student card. Mr. W then
answered some of the questions on the exam. The invigilator's suspicion was
rnised by the observation that othel' information disclosed that H
L
was a woman, and yet a man was writing the exam in her name, and Mr. W
appears to have been confronted about this at the time.
[21] Each of the students attended a "Dean's Meetingn. Although Ms. L

initially
denied that she knew Mr. W she subsequently admitted that she had asked him
to write her exam and admitted that she had given her driver's licence to him.

[22] At Mr. W 's Dean's Meeting, he admitted that he had attended and written the
exam in Ms. L
's name, and he fu11her admitted that he had presented the
forged driver's licence and forged student card at the exam.
Second Sets of Cha1·ges
[23] Following the investigation of the events of December 4, 2009, the University

conducted ftuiher investigation and additional academic offences came to light.
Summarized briefly from the ASF, these include the following:
(a) ECMC62H3-lnternational Economics: Trade and Theory, On April 16,
2009, Ms. L _ was scheduled to write the final exam in this course, wo11h
60% of her mark. In her place, and on her instmctions, Mr. W attended the
final exam, where he impersonated H
L
and wrote the exam for
he1·.
(b)

GGRC46H3: Tourism, Envh-onment and Development. M1·. W took
this course in the Winter 2009 term. He wrote an exam on April 20, 2009,
wo1ih 35% of the final mark, at which no aids were allowed. However, Mr.
W brought into the exam room pre-written answers, which he wrote into the
exam book. Ms. 1
took the same course in the Fall 2009 term, and at the
final exam in that course written on December 15, 2009 (again wo1ih 35% of
the grnde}, Ms. L. , brought h1to the exam room pre-written answers which
she wrote down as if she had written them during the exam without the use of
any aids. The pre-written answers of Mr. W and Ms. L
we1·e virtually
identical. Further, many of the answers are copied vhiually verbatim from
external sources, and without attribution.

(c)

POLB81H3: Internatio11al Conflict and Conflict Management, Ms.
L
was enro1led in this course in the Winter 2009 term. At the final exam
worth 40% of the final mark in the course, on April 20, 2009, Ms. L
brought into the exam room copies of text from external sources which she
usrd to assist her in answering the questions, without attribution. No aid$

- 17 -

were permitted. A review of Ms. L
's answer booklet reveals that some
of her answers were copied from those external sources.
(d) ECMB05H3: Macro Economic Theory and Policy. Ms. L
was
enrolled in this course in the 2009 Winter term. At the final exam worth 50%
of the final course mark, held on April 23, 2009, on Ms. L
's instrnctions
Mr. W attended and wrote the exam in her place, as if he was Ms. L
(e)

IDSB05H3: Economics of Small Enterprise and Micro Credit. Mr. W
and Ms. L
. were both enrolled in this course in the 2009 Fall term. The
final exam, worth 40% of the final course grade was scheduled to be written
on December 14, 2009. No aids were allowed. A comparison of their answer
books reveals that many of the answers given to the exam questions by these
two students were very similar and, in some cases, identical. The students
each admitted in the Agreed Statement of Facts that they used or possessed
unauthorized aids and provided unauthorized assistance to one another at the
final exam.

(f)

POLB90H3: Comparative Development in International Perspective.

Mr. W and Ms. L
were both enrolled in this course in the 2009 Fall
term. At the final exam worth 40% of the final mark, held on December 15,
2009, no aids were allowed. Again, a compadson of the answer books of
each student reveals that many of the sho1t answers given to the exam
questions by these two students were very similar and their answers to the
long essay question were virtually identical. Further, their virtually identical
essay answers were copied verbatim from external sources, without
attribution.
Penalty

[24] A Joint Submission on Penalty was presented for each of Mr. W and Ms.
L
. They called for assignments of grades of zero in each of the courses
affected, recommendations of expulsion, and suspensions for up to five years
pending the decision of the Governing Council with respect to expulsion. In
addition, the University of Toronto requested that a report of the decision be
made to the Provost who may publish a notice of the decision of the Tribunal
and the sanctions imposed, with the students' names withheld.
[25] Ms. Harme1~ in helpful submissions, took us through a number of University
Tribunal decisions to support the recommendation of expulsion. She noted that
these were egregious cases of academic dishonesty, affecting seven courses for
Ms. L
and three courses for Mr. W , which involved a high degree of
planning, including forging student identification and a Government of Ontario
driver's licence.

- 18 -

(26] Ms. Harmer took us through the relevant factors in ordel' to justify the
recommendation of expulsion. She noted that the students cheated extensively,
and that even after they were caught on December 4, 2009, the students
committed further academic offences later in the same month. This
demonstrated that there was a real concern about a likelihood of repetition. The
nature of the offences is clearly very serious, and is often hard to discover. No
extenuating circumstances were put forward. In short, there was a pattern of
complete disregard for academic honesty, and in fact a pattern of deliberate
disregard based on the careful planning and premeditation involved in
committing the offences.
[27] Mr. Goldbloom made no submissions to raise any extenuating circumstances.

[28] Accordingly, the panel was satisfied that Joint Submissions on Penalty were
appropriate having regard to the circumstances and prim: cases. The panel
therefore recommends the following sanctions:
\Vith Respect to D W

1.

that a final grade of zero be recorded foi· each of GORC46H3 for
Winter 2009, IDSB05H3 for Fall 2009, and POLB90H3 for Fall
2009;

2.

that Mr. W be suspended from the University commencing
November 23, 2010, fo1· a period not to exceed five yem·s;

3.

that the President of the University recommend to the Goveming
Council that Mr. W be expelled from the University; and

4.

that this case be rep011ed to the Provost fol' publication of a notice of
the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed..
with the name of the student withheld.

As ngainst H

L.

t.

that a final grade of zero be recorded for each of ECMC92H3 for
Winter 2009, ECMC62H3 for Winter 2009, GGRC46H3 for Fall
2009, POLB81HE for Winter 2009, ECMB05H3 for Wintel' 2009,
IDSB05H3 for Fall 2009, POLB90H3 for Fall 2009;

2.

that Ms. L ; be suspended from the University commencing

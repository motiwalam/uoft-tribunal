   Grievances

   Student charged with personation of two faculty members and two
   offences under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code . The personation charges
   related to a scheme that the Student pretended to be a faculty member
   in correspondence with another faculty member. It was a sophisticated
   scheme the end goal of which was obtaining an exam. It was not a single
   isolated instance of bad judgement but a planned and deliberate
   attempt. The Student failed to obtain an exam and attended the exam on
   April 15, 2013 where he confirmed his attendance but removed an exam
   from the room. The Student met with the Dean‚s Designate where he
   acknowledged that he removed the paper from the exam but denied
   impersonating the faculty member. The meeting was adjourned one week
   for the Student to seek legal advice and upon reconvention the Student
   admitted his personation scheme.

   The Student appeared at the disciplinary hearing and admitted his guilt
   and the University withdrew one count. The University sought a penalty
   including a grade of zero in the course, a four year suspension, the
   sanction recorded on his academic record until graduation, and that the
   case be reported to the Provost for publication. The Student filed a
   ‚Letter of Mitigation‚ expressing remorse for his conduct. He asked the
   Panel to take into account that it was his first offense, he had good
   overall academic standing, and that he felt compelled to carry out his
   scheme due to immense pressure from his family. The Panel felt that
   while the Student did feel deep remorse he did not take full
   responsibility for his actions. The conduct required a severe sanction
   because if the Student‚s scheme had succeeded he would almost certainly
   have been expelled. That he failed and admitted guilt justifies a
   reduction in length of suspension to four years. The Panel ordered a
   grade of zero in the course, a four year suspension, that this sanction
   be recorded on his academic record until graduation, and ordered that
   the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

Introduction
1. The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened via videoconference on October 25,
2022 to consider charges brought against M
T
(the “Student”) by the University of
Toronto (“the University”) pursuant to the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters, 1995 (the “Code”) on July 28, 2022. The charges involve allegations of academic
dishonesty on three separate occasions. The charges alleged that the Student knowingly represented
as their own an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another, on or about October 20,
2021 in a mid-term test in the course PSY240H5F, on or about October 22, 2022 in a mid-term test
in the course PSY270H5F, and on or about December 20, 2021 in the final exam in the course
PSY240H5F.
2. The charges were as follows:
1.

On or about October 20, 2021, you knowingly represented as your own an idea or expression of an

Liability
5. The Provost of the University and the Student filed a Joint Book of Documents, which included an
Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) that was signed by the Student on October 13, 2022. The
5

University and the Student agreed that each of the documents attached to the ASF could be admitted
into evidence before the Tribunal for all purposes, including for the truth of the document’s
contents, without further need to prove the document, and that, if a document indicates that it was
sent or received by someone, that is prima facie proof that the document was sent and received as
indicated.
6. The relevant facts in this matter, as set forth in the ASF, are reproduced here (with references to
underlying documentation removed):
A. Background
7.

In Fall 2021, the student enrolled in PSY240H5F: Introduction to Abnormal Psychology
(“PSY240”), which was taught by Simone Walker. The student admits that she received and
reviewed a copy of the PSY240 syllabus at the start of the semester.

reviewed a copy of the PSY270 syllabus at the start of the semester.

B. Offence 1: The PSY240 Midterm
9.

Students in PSY240 were required to write a midterm, which was worth 30% of their final grade
in the course (the “PSY240 Midterm”). The PSY240 Midterm was administered on October 20,
2021. The PSY240 Midterm stated that students were not permitted to use any aids, and students
were required to confirm that they would adhere to the Code.

10. On October 20, 2021, the student submitted her PSY240 Midterm. The student confirmed that
she adhered to the Code in writing her PSY240 Midterm.
11. Professor Walker reviewed the student’s PSY240 Midterm and found that all of the student’s
short answer responses were copied from online sources without attribution, including:

PSY240 Midterm to the PSY240 Midterm Sources.
C. Offence 2: The PSY270 Midterm
14. Students in PSY270 were required to write a midterm, which was worth 28% of their final grade
(the “PSY270 Midterm”). The PSY270 Midterm was administered on October 22, 2021. The
PSY270 Midterm was an open-book test in which students were permitted to use their course
notes and textbook, but the professor provided clear written instructions on Quercus, as well as
verbally during lecture, that students were not to make use of any external sources.
15. On October 22, 2021, the student submitted her PSY270 Midterm.

PSY270 Midterm to the PSY270 Midterm Sources.
19. Professor Burton’s academic integrity report states that, in addition to the PSY270 Midterm
Sources, the student copied some of her PSY270 Midterm answers from the Fall 2020 and
Winter 2018 PSY270 midterm answer keys without attribution. The student copied these
answers from Course Hero, which contained copies of PSY270 answer keys from prior years,
without attribution. Course Hero is an online learning platform that advertises it offers millions
of course-specific study resources. The student does not have copies of these Course Hero
documents but admits that she accessed and copied these answers from Course Hero without
attribution during the PSY270 Midterm.

F. The Dean’s Designate meeting
27. On February 8, 2022, the student met with Dean’s Designate Michael Georges to discuss her
PSY270 Midterm, her PSY240 Midterm, and her PSY240 Final. The student acknowledges that
Professor Georges provided her with the required warnings under the Code. During the
meeting, Professor Georges went over parts of the PSY270 Midterm report, the PSY240
Midterm report, and the PSY240 Final report with the student. After going over each report,
the student admitted to plagiarism in her PSY270 Midterm, her PSY240 Midterm, and her
PSY240 Final.
G. Admissions and acknowledgements

8

28. The student admits that:
(a)

she plagiarized and obtained unauthorized assistance from the PSY240 Midterm
Sources in her PSY240 Midterm;

(b)

she plagiarized and obtained unauthorized assistance from the PSY270 Midterm
Sources and Course Hero in her PSY270 Midterm; and

(c)

she plagiarized and obtained unauthorized assistance from the PSY240 Final Sources
in her PSY240 Final.

29. The student admits that, in the PSY240 Midterm, the PSY270 Midterm, and the PSY240 Final,
she knew or ought to have known that:
(a)

she was representing the ideas of another author, the expression of the ideas of the
author, and the work of the author as her own, contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the Code;

(b)

she used or possessed an unauthorized aid or aids or obtained unauthorized assistance,
contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code; and

(c)

she engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic
credit or other academic advantage of any kind, contrary to section B.I.3(b) of the
Code.

30. The student acknowledges that she is signing this ASF freely and voluntarily, knowing of the
potential consequences she faces, and does so with the advice of counsel or having waived the
right to obtain counsel.
31. The student acknowledges that the Provost has made no representations to her regarding what
penalty she will seek in this proceeding.

7. The onus on the University was to establish on a balance of probabilities, through clear and
convincing evidence, that the Student had committed an academic offence.
8. As noted above, the Student was charged with three counts of knowingly representing as her own
an idea or expression of an idea or the work of another, under section B.I.1(d) of the Code. The
Student was also charged, in the alternative, with three counts of knowingly possessing an aid or
aids or obtaining unauthorized assistance, under section B.I.1(b) of the Code. Additionally, the
student was charged, in the further alternative, with three counts of knowingly engaging in a form
of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise
described in the Code to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind, under
section B.I.3(b) of the Code.
9. Upon review of the ASF (including the Student’s admissions contained in the ASF) and the
documents attached to the ASF, and upon hearing the submissions of counsel, the Tribunal was
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, on all three occasions at issue – the mid-term test in
PSY240H5F on October 20, 2021; the mid-term test in PSY270H5F on October 22, 2021; and the
final exam in PSY240H5F on December 20, 2021 – the Student knowingly represented as her own
an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another. The Tribunal therefore accepted the
Student’s guilty plea in respect of the three counts of the offence under section B.I.1(d) of the Code.
10. In light of the Tribunal’s finding on this charge, the second set of charges, relating to possession of
aids or obtaining of unauthorized assistance contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code in respect of
the two mid-term tests and the final exam, was withdrawn by the University. Additionally, the third
9

set of charges, relating to other forms of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code contrary to section B.I.3(b) of the Code in
respect of the two mid-term tests and the final exam, was withdrawn by the University.

III.

Penalty
11. The Joint Book of Documents filed by the Provost of the University and the Student included an
Agreed Statement of Facts on Penalty (“ASF-Penalty”) that was signed by the Student on October
13, 2022. The University and the Student agreed that each of the documents attached to the ASFPenalty could be admitted into evidence before the Tribunal for all purposes, including for the truth
of the document’s contents, without further need to prove the document, and that, if a document
indicates that it was sent or received by someone, that is prima facie proof that the document was
sent and received as indicated.
12. The facts in this matter relevant to penalty, as set forth in the ASF-Penalty, are reproduced here
(with references to underlying documentation removed):
2.

The Academic Integrity Unit at the University of Toronto Mississauga maintains a database of
allegations of academic misconduct that have been made against students. There is a discipline case
report for each allegation in the database, which records the details relating to the allegation and the
outcome.

A. First Offence: Plagiarism
3.

In Fall 2020, the student enrolled in ANT102H5F. On November 29, 2020, the student submitted her
final paper in ANT102H5F, which was worth 20% of her final grade.

4.

On February 22, 2021, the Academic Integrity Unit emailed the student about her final paper. The
Academic Integrity Unit noted that substantial sections of her final paper appeared to be copied from
published sources without proper acknowledgment. The Academic Integrity Unit gave the student the
opportunity to admit to plagiarism and accept the following sanction:
(a)

a mark of zero on the final paper, and

(b)

a 12-month notation on the student’s academic record and transcript from March 12,
2021, to March 12, 2022.

5.

The Academic Integrity Unit’s email contained the following warning: “Please note that should a
subsequent allegation of misconduct be brought to my attention, it will be taken into account that this is
not your first allegation and the consequences may be more severe.”

6.

Later that day, the student responded to the Academic Integrity Unit by admitting to plagiarizing in her
final paper and accepting the proposed sanction.

7.

The University of Toronto Mississauga subsequently imposed this sanction on the student.

8.

The student acknowledges that she is signing this ASF freely and voluntarily, knowing of the potential
consequences she faces, and does so with the advice of counsel or having waived the right to obtain
counsel.

9.

The student acknowledges that the Provost has made no representations to her regarding what penalty
she will seek in this proceeding.

10

13. The Joint Book of Documents filed by the Provost of the University and the Student included a
Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”). The JSP was signed by the Student on October 18, 2022. The
JSP requested that the sanction in this matter be as follows:
(a)

A final grade of zero in PSY240H5F in Fall 2021;

(b)

A final grade of zero in PSY270H5F in Fall 2021;

(c)

A suspension from the University for three years and eight months
commencing on January 1, 2023; and

(d)

A notation of the offence on the student’s academic [record] and [transcript]
for five years from the date of Tribunal’s order. (NOTE: It was discovered
post-hearing that the language in the JSP and Order erroneously referred to the
student’s “academic and record” instead of “academic record and transcript”.
The corrected language is reflected here.)

14. The JSP also indicated that the parties agree that it is appropriate for this case to be reported to the
Provost for publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed in the
University of Toronto newspapers, with the name of the Student withheld.
15. The JSP contained an acknowledgement from the Student that she had signed the JSP freely and
voluntarily, knowing of the potential consequences she faced and knowing that the Tribunal is not
bound by the JSP and has the discretion to impose a different penalty, including a more severe one.
16. The Student provided affidavit evidence on the issue of penalty. The affidavit outlined various
personal difficulties that the Student was experiencing at the time she committed the offences. The
personal difficulties she was experiencing were a consequence of the COVID pandemic. They
included mental health issues, isolation, difficulty sleeping, tension headaches, and difficulty
focusing on her studies. She nonetheless wished to succeed academically. This resulted in her
committing the offences at issue. In her affidavit, the Student admitted to plagiarizing and obtaining
unauthorized assistance in all three of the exams and voiced regret and remorse for her actions.
Since committing the offences, she has been using online resources to help her develop coping
strategies for her mental health issue, which have resulted in an improvement of her health. She is
confident that she will be able to use the coping strategies she has learned to prevent similar
situations involving academic dishonesty from recurring in the future.
17. Both counsel for the University and representative for the Student made oral submissions with
respect to penalty.
18. When a JSP is filed, as here, the Tribunal is not bound to follow it when determining the sanction
in the case before it. However, the case law is clear that a JSP should be disregarded by the Tribunal
only where giving effect to the sanction would be contrary to the public interest or would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute (see, e.g, University of Toronto and Y.W. (Case No. 1155,
July 26, 2021), University of Toronto and P.H.Q. (Case No. 982, May 8, 2019)).
19. In the circumstances of this case, for the reasons outlined below, the Tribunal had no concern that
proceeding in accordance with the JSP would be contrary to the public interest or bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.
20. The Tribunal considered the principles and factors relevant to sanction as articulated in University
of Toronto and Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5, 1976). The Tribunal determined that
11

these factors supported the imposition of the JSP. In this regard, the Tribunal observed the
following:
a. The nature of the offence and the detriment to the University occasioned by the offence.
The offence is serious in nature and causes great detriment to the University and its
students. A number of Tribunal decisions (e.g. University of Toronto and Y.G. (Case No.
802, September 28, 2015)) have observed that plagiarism corrodes academic integrity at
the University and undermines the relationship of trust between the University and its
students. For these reasons, plagiarism is considered in the cases to be a very serious
offence that warrants a serious penalty. The plagiarism involved here was deliberate and
extensive.
b. The need to deter others from committing a similar offence. There is a strong need to deter
others from committing a similar offence, for many of the reasons noted above. This type
of offence poses a grave threat to the integrity of the University’s processes for evaluating
students, is profoundly unfair to other students, and jeopardizes the University’s reputation.
c. The likelihood of a repetition of the offence. The Student has committed plagiarism four
times in total. The latter three of those offences formed the subject matter of this hearing.
The first offence took place in February 2021 and resulted in the Student being issued a
warning. The second and third offences took place in October 2021 and led to the Student
meeting with both of the course professors in the month of November 2021. In December
2021, the Student committed the fourth offence. The Tribunal was concerned by the
multiple instances of plagiarism. The Tribunal was also concerned that the second and third
offences took place after the Student had received a warning in respect of the first offence,
and that the fourth offence took place the month after the Student met with the course
professors in respect of the prior two offences. Although the Tribunal appreciates that the
Student has voiced regret and remorse over her actions, the Tribunal does have some
concern about possible future repetition. In the Tribunal’s view, a significant period of
suspension is therefore appropriate.
d. The character of the Student. The Tribunal was concerned by the number of occasions of
plagiarism and by their timing relative to one another and to the Student’s receipt of a
warning and meetings with her professors. However, the Tribunal also noted certain
considerations that mitigated against a more severe penalty. The Student accepted
responsibility for, and demonstrated insight into, her behaviour by pleading guilty early in
the process, at the Dean’s meeting in February 2022. She cooperated with the University’s
academic discipline process, including by attending the hearing before the Tribunal. Her
affidavit evidence articulated her regret and remorse for her actions and indicated that she
has been seeking help for her mental health issues through on-line resources.
e. Extenuating circumstances. At the time she committed the offences, the Student was
experiencing personal difficulties due to the COVID pandemic, including mental health
issues.
21. The Tribunal was satisfied that these various factors were appropriately reflected in the JSP.
22. In support of the three year and eight-month suspension contained in the JSP, the Tribunal was
directed by the parties to a number of prior decisions of the Tribunal in which students who had
committed multiple prior or concurrent offences were suspended for three to five years.

23. Cases in which a three-year suspension was imposed (e.g. University of Toronto and Q.H. (Case
No. 1003, February 22, 2019), University of Toronto and S.S. (Case No. 910, June 8, 2017), and
University of Toronto and D.L. (Case No. 1090, March 4, 2021)) generally have been ones in which
the students had fewer offences than in this case.
24. Cases in which a five-year suspension was imposed (e.g. University of Toronto and S.P. (Case No.
654, August 9, 2012) and University of Toronto and I.S. (Case No. 1212, November 3, 2021))
generally involved multiple prior offences, like this case, but involved more offences and, in some
cases, no evidence of mitigation. For example, in University of Toronto and S.P., the Student had
committed four prior offences, one of which resulted in a 12-month suspension; one term after
returning from the suspension the Student committed another offence. Additionally, there were no
challenging personal circumstances that gave rise to the offences at issue.
25. Cases in which a four-year suspension was imposed (e.g. University of Toronto and K.P. (Case No.
660, February 6, 2012) and University of Toronto and O.E. (Case No. 923, August 30, 2017)) were
factually closer to this case: they involved multiple prior offences and warnings, and students who
had cooperated with the University’s academic discipline process, and mitigating circumstances.
26. The Tribunal determined that the JSP proposed here fell within the well-defined range of penalties
established by the jurisprudence for cases like this one.
27. The Tribunal also determined that, in all of the circumstances, the appropriate penalty was the one
submitted by the parties in the JSP.

IV.

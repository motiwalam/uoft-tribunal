   Grievances

   Student charged with three offences under s. B.i.3(a), six offences
   under s. B.i.1(a) and in the alternative, one offence under s. B.i.3(b)
   of the Code. The charges related to allegations that the student had
   forged and falsified several documents purporting to be transcripts
   from other universities and submitted these in support of two
   applications for admission to the University, and one application to
   transfer within the University from the Mississauga to the St. George
   campus. The Student did not attend the hearing but the Panel was
   satisfied that the Student had reasonable notice of the hearing and had
   been served in accordance with the Rules of Practice and Procedure of
   the University Tribunal. Evidence was presented by way of an affidavit
   of the Assistant Faculty Registrar who was on leave from the University
   at the time. The Panel accepted the affidavit as evidence in accordance
   with the University Tribunal Rules of Practice and Procedure. The
   University withdrew one of the six charges under s. B.i.1(a) and the
   alternative charge. The Panel found the Student guilty of the remaining
   eight charges. The Panel noted that the conduct of the Student was
   serious, repetitive, and egregious. The Panel observed that there was
   no indication of respect by the Student for the discipline process, nor
   any indication of remorse or extenuating circumstances. The Panel
   stated that the Studentâs conduct caused serious harm to the integrity
   of the Universityâs academic process and that significant sanction was
   necessary. The Panel imposed a five-year suspension, cancelled 7.0
   transfer credits granted to the Student on the basis of falsified
   documents, recommended that the Student be expelled from the
   University, and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for
   publication.

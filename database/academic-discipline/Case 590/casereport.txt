The Tribunal's Conclusion on the Appropriate Penalty

14.

The Tribunal considered numerous cases before other panels of the University's Tribunal
that considered sentencing guidelines in matters of academic offences. These cases set
out the following sentencing criteria:

15.

(a)

the character of the person charged;

(b)

the likelihood of the repetition of the offence;

(c)

the nature of the offence committed;

(d)

any extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;

(e)

the detriment to the University occasioned by the offence; and

(Â±)

the need to deter others from committing a similar offence.

The Tribunal was provided with a Book of Authorities with numerous cases dealing with
other instances where students had been found guilty of offences involving forged or
falsified documents. Jn the overwhelming majority of these cases, the penalty imposed
was expulsion. Jn many of these cases the students had entered into Agreed Statements
of Fact and Joint Submissions on Penalty. In many of these cases the students attended
the hearing. The clear weight of authority, based on these cases, is that the appropriate
penalty is expulsion where there is falsification or forgery of docwncnts.

16.

The Student's conduct clearly violated all of the University's policies and guidelines with
respect to ethical conduct. The Tribunal considered the Student's conduct to be at the

6

most serious end of the spectrum in terms of the principles of integrity and reputation of
the University.
17.

In this case the Student falsified two documents, one of which was a University degree.
Although the academic transcript was an unofficial transcript, there was a clear intention
to put forward false statements concerning his record at the University.

18.

The Tribunal noted that the Student did attend the hearing and did cooperate throughout
the course of the investigation and acknowledged his conduct.

Notwithstanding the

Student's cooperation, the Tribunal concluded that, in order to maintain the integrity of
the University's ethical rules and the Code, it had no alternative, but to recommend the
penalty of expulsion. The Tribunal encouraged the Student to continue to pursue his goal
of achieving a higher education, recognizing that he did learn an important lesson from
this experience.

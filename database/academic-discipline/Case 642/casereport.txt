Ms. P
was not present at the hearing. Prior to the hem-ing, she provided
counsel for the University with an executed Consent in which she confirmed that she had
received a copy of the Notice of hearing dated April 5, 2011; that the University had
provided her with reasonable ncitice of this hearing; that she requests that this Tribunal
proceed in her absence; that she waives her right to any fmther notice of these
proceedings; that she has signed an Agreed Statement of Facts and a Joint Submission on
Penalty; that she does not wish to attend or participate further in these proceedings; and
that she understands that, in her absence, the Tribunal may find that she has com111itted an
act or acts of acade111ic misconduct and may i111pose sanctions against her as set out in the
Code. Ms. P
was not represented by counsel at the hearing.

AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS & FINDING OF GUILT

[4]

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the University had entered into
an Agreed Statement of Facts with Ms. P "
· . That document is attached as
Appendix A to this decision. Pursuant to that Agceed Statement of Facts, lv!s.
P
pleaded guilty to all 14 charges filed by the Provost. The University
agreed tbm, if the Tribunal convicted Ms. P
on charges l and 2, the
Provost would withdraw charge 3; that, if the Tribunal convicted her on charges 4-6, the
Provost would withdraw charge 7; that, if the Tribunal convicted her on charges 8-10, the
Provost would withdraw charge 11; and that, if the Tribunal convicted her on charges 12
and 13, the Provost would withdraw charge 14.

(5]

After reviewing the facts contained in the Agreed Statement of facts, the Tribunal
deliberated and concluded that the facts form the foundation for a finding of guilt on
charges 1, 2, 4-6, 8-10, 12, and 13, and agreed to accept the guilty pleas in respect of
those charges.

JOINT SUBMISSION ON PENALTY & SANCTION

[6]

The parties submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty, in which it was jointly proposed
that Ms. P
be given a final grade of zero in each of the courses UN 204
HS S (English Grammar), PHL243S (Philosophy of Human Sexuality), SOC222H5
(Measming Society), and SOC221H5S (The Logic of Social Inquiry); that she be
suspended from the University from April 5, 2011 until April 5, 2016; and that a notation
be made of the sanction on her academic record and transcript from the date of the Order
until April 5, 2016. That document is attached as Appendix B.

[7]

It was also jointly submitted that this case be reported to the Provost for publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction imposed in the
's name withheld.
University newspapers, with Ms. P

(8]

There is a high threshold in order for the Tribunal to reject a Joint Submission on Penalty.
To meet this threshold, the Tribunal would have to be of the view that accepting the Joint
Submission on Penalty would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The
Tribunal has concluded that this is not such a case, and that it is therefore appropriate to
accept the Joint Submission on Penalty.
5

(9]

The Tribunal, in arriving at this conclusion, considered the factors that arc to govem its
sanctioning decisions, as set out by Mr. Sopinka, as he then was, in The Universily of
Toronlo and Mr. C., dated November 5, 1976. The Tribunal concluded that those factors
support the imposition of the penalty set out in the Joint Submission on Penalty in this
matter. Ms. P
has admitted to submitting false information and falsified
documents to her professors on four distinct occasions in an effort to defer her course
examinations. She committed these offences in respect of two different courses in 2008,
and then again in respect of one course in 2009 and one course in 20 I 0. The false
information she included in her petitions included, on each occasion, the statement that
there had been a death in her family. The falsified documents submitted in support of the
petitions included, on each occasion, fabricated death announcements, typically complete
with the name of the deceased, his or her photograph, and details about the funeral
service. Significantly, she has admitted that she knowingly provided this false
information and these forged or falsified documents to the University in order to obtain
an academic advantage and mislead her instructors, and with the expectation that the
instructors would rely on this information to their detriment and would provide her with
an academic advantage.

[ l O]

These are very serious offences to which Ms. P
i,,;s admitted. Providing
false information and falsified documents to a professor even once is a serious offence.
Ms. P
' 'i has admitted to committing such acts on four distinct occasions
over a period ot iwo years. In doing this, she altempted to obtain an advantage for
herself, and acted to the detriment of her fellow students and of the University.

[ l l]

The Tribunal is of the view that the Joint Submission on Penalty calls for a penalty that is
clearly reasonable. The case law shows that the offences to which Ms. P,
has admitted often lead to 5 year suspensions, and notations on transcripts for even longer
durations than the one proposed in the Joint Submission on Penalty here (see, e.g.,
Universily of Toran/a and lvUi, dated September 20, 20 IO; Universily of Toran/a and
lvf. I~. dated July 23, 2008; Universily of Toronto and 1.lvf dated January 20, 2010; and
Universily a/Toronto and B.R.N., dated February 28, 2011).

(12]

Finally, the Tribunal finds that there is no reason to believe that the administration of
justice would be brought into disrep11te by its accepting the Joint Submission on Penalty.
The Tribunal readily accepts that Ms. P
has obtained or had the
opportunity to obtain independent legal advice in respect of this matter; that she has had
appropriate notice of the hearing and has requested that the hearing proceed in her
absence; and that she has signed both the Agreed Statement of Facts and the Joint
Submission on Penalty freely, voluntarily, and with knowledge of the potential
consequences she faces.

(13]

The Tribunal is accordingly of the view that the penalty outlined in the Joint Submission
on Penalty is appropriate, and accepts the Joint Submission on Penalty, An Order to this
effect has been issued.

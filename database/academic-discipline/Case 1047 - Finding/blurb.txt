Trial division – s. B.i.l(b) of the Code – unauthorized aid - the Student knowingly used or possessed an unauthorized aid or obtained unauthorized assistance in connection with a final examination – invigilator found unauthorized aid sheet on Student’s carrel during final examination – diverging evidence from invigilator and student raised credibility issue – finding of guilt – the Student ought reasonably to have known that he possessed the unauthorized aid sheet – Panel considered several factors to assess credibility and preferred the invigilator’s evidence over the Student’s evidence – no obligation on the Student to prove that the unauthorized aid sheet was not his because onus always remains on the University to establish its case on a balance of probabilities - no finding as to whether the Student attempted to use or used the unauthorized aid sheet.

The student Mr. C

A

was charged with the following academic

offence which came before the panel on January 8, 2016:
On or about August 27, 2015, you knowingly forged,
or in any other way altered or falsified an academic
record, and/or other, circulated or made use of such
forged altered or falsified record, namely, a document
labelled “Academic History” that purported to be your
academic record and unofficial transcript from the
University of Toronto, contrary to section B.I. 3. (a) of
the Code [of behaviour on academic matters, 1995].
2.

-

Mr. A

did not appear at the hearing. As we will discuss at the foot of

these reasons we believe him to have been properly served with process. We
heard evidence and argument on behalf of the Provost, and found that Mr.

-

A

had committed the offence charged.

The Facts
3.

On August 27, 2015 Mr. Paul Sharpe of the Undergraduate Admissions

Office of the University of London wrote to Mr. Damon Chevrier of St. Michael’s
College at the University to inquire about the academic qualifications which had

-

been presented by Mr. A

. Mr. Sharpe observed “[p]reviously, he has only

sent us unofficial documents evidencing his performance on the degree which we
have been unable to use to proceed with his application […]. We have now
received the attached document directly from the student claiming that it is his
final graduation transcript.”

Mr. Sharpe observed that the document did not

seem to be a typical University of Toronto transcript, and sought confirmation that

Page 3

the student had indeed earned the Bachelor of Arts Degree with a cumulative
GPA of 3.12.
Mr. Chevrier remitted the document to Sana Kawar, the manager of University
transcripts centre. Ms. Kawar sent an email to Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Chevrier
which stated in part,
“…clearly this is not a transcript as issued by the
university, rather a printout of a total academic history
that students can access to view and print from our
online service for their own use. […] I can verify that it
is not a complete version some courses have been
omitted, thus, the GPA’s and the total number of
credits completed are not accurate. No degrees have
been awarded for this student.”
4.

-

She went on to observe that a financial hold had been placed on Mr.

A

’s academic record and that an official transcript would not be issued until

5.

Given that testimony, we find that Mr. A

that was removed.

-

had not received a degree

from the University of Toronto, but falsely represented to the University of
London that he had done so.
6.

-

We are also satisfied that Mr. A

also falsified the individual grades on

the “transcript” hesubmitted to the University of London. For example, in the
course CAS400Y1 his actual grade was 37, but he claimed to have achieved a

-

78 in the course; in the course EAS474H1 Mr. A

received a zero, but

claimed to have achieved a mark of 80. We have attached the comparison of the
falsified and actual academic history to these Reasons.

7.

- -

Mr. Chevrier wrote to Mr. A

on August 27, 2015 immediately after the

University discovered the issues with Mr. A
University of London. He offered Mr. A

’s representations to the

the opportunity to meet informally to

explain what had happened. He reiterated his offer on August 28, 2015. Since

--

he did not hear from Mr. A
8.

, he referred the matter to the Office of the Dean.

Professor Donald Dewees, who is the Dean’s Designate for Academic

Integrity wrote to Mr. A

on September 2, 2015. He offered the opportunity

to meet with the Dean or his designate to discuss the matter.
9.

-

Both Mr. Chevrier and Professor Dewees corresponded with Mr. A

his email address c
A

.a

at

@utoronto.ca. No response was received from Mr.

to any of these emails from either Mr. Chevrier or Professor Dewees,

notwithstanding follow up emails on September 8, 2015 or September 15, 2015.
10.

Accordingly, these proceedings were commenced by the Provost.

Disposition
11.

-

We are satisfied beyond doubt that Mr. A

charged.

committed the offence

Service
12.

We are satisfied that we were entitled to proceed with this matter. Within

the Code, under C. II (a) Tribunal Procedures, the requirements for service are
established:
Notice of Hearing

Page 5

4. Upon receipt by the Secretary of a charge which appears to be in
proper form, the member of the Tribunal designated to the Chair of the
hearing and the Secretary shall immediately determine and give
appropriate notice of the date, time and place for the hearing.

13.

Further, pursuant to Section 9 of the Rules of Practice and Procedures of

the University Tribunal, a notice of hearing could be served by personal service,
but also by
Service of Documents
9(b)

by sending a copy of the document by courier to the student’s mailing
address contained in ROSI […]

9 (c)

by emailing a copy of the document to the student’s email address
contained in ROSI or to the student’s representative […]

14.

The student was not represented at any stage of these proceedings. The

Provost met the requirement in s. 9(c) by emailing to a student’s email address
as contained in ROSI.
15.

Mr. Centa quite fairly drew to our attention an email login document

-

obtained from the system administrator which made it clear that Mr. A

last

logged in to his ROSI email address on September 14, 2015 at 1:21am and
logged out some 24 minutes later. Mr. Centa consequently accepted that Mr.

-

A

did not have actual notice of the charges laid against him, or that a

hearing was to take place on the date fixed. At the same time, he submitted, and

-

we accept, that Mr. A

should be taken to have had notice of a serious

Page 6

academic discipline issue by reason of the correspondence referred to above
which came from Mr. Chevrier.
16.

For these reasons, we were satisfied that the Provost was entitled to

proceed with the hearing, and we did so.
17.

-

Should Mr. A

wish to raise issues concerning a failure to provide

notice, or if there are circumstances unknown to us which on review appear to
have rendered these proceedings unfair, that will be for the Discipline Appeal
Board to consider.

Penalty
18.

We were provided with a chart setting out a summary of cases contained

in the Provost’s Book of Authorities.

The Provost submitted that the proper

-

penalty was expulsion given the blatant dishonesty exhibited by Mr. A

both

in claiming a degree which had not been awarded and falsely suggesting that he
had achieved academic success considerably at variance from the results
recorded on his transcript.
19.

Mr. Centa submitted to us that the proper penalty in these circumstances

was, as the Book of Authorities filed by the Provost reflects, expulsion. We
accept that this is the penalty typically handed down in cases of this sort. To cite
just one case, that of The University v MK, (Case 491, Mr. Ronald G. Slaght QC,
Chair, pp 12-13), we agree that the penalty of expulsion is necessary in this
case, in his words:

Page 7

"to protect the integrity of the University community,
the compelling need to signal and to underscore the
deterrent effect and reiterate that such conduct will
and must meet with the most severe reaction when
uncovered."
20.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will recommend to the President and that he

recommend to the Governing Council, that Mr. ~ be expelled, and that a
permanent notation to that effect be made on his academic record.
21.

Mr. ~ shall also be immediately be suspended from the University for

a period of up to five years.
This case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction imposed, with the name of
the student withheld

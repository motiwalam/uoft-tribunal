   Student charged under s. B.i.1(f) and s. B.i.1(a) of the Code . The
   charges related to allegations that the Student concocted references to
   one or more sources in a research report, and that when offered a
   proposed sanction for the concoction, the Student knowingly altered or
   falsified the sanction letter to reduce the suggested penalty in his
   appeal of the sanction. The Student was not present at the hearing. The
   Panel heard evidence that the Student had accessed his ROSI account.
   The Panel found that reasonable notice of the hearing had been provided
   in accordance with the Code , and the hearing continued in the absence
   of the Student.
   Student found guilty with respect to both charges. The Panel accepted
   evidence that the sources referenced in the Studentâs report did not
   exist, and evidence that the University sanction document had been
   altered by the Student. The Panel emphasized the severity of the
   allegations, noting its astonishment that in the process of exercising
   his right to appeal his concoction sanction the Student would falsify
   the very document under consideration by the Vice Provost. The Panel
   concluded that its sanction for the Student should reflect the
   abhorrence of the Tribunal for this kind of misconduct, and should seek
   to deter other students from contemplating any sort of alternation of
   University documents. The Panel imposed a 5-year suspension; a
   recommendation of expulsion; and that the case be reported to the
   Provost for publication.

Preliminary

[1]

The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on January 13,
2014 to consider charges under the University of Toronto Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (the "Code") laid against the
Student by letter dated September 17, 2013 from Professor Edith Hillan,
Vice-Provost, Faculty and Academic Life.

[2]

The Student and the University entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts
("ASF") and a Joint Submission on Penalty ("JSP"), copies of which are
attached to these Reasons as Appendix "A" and "B" respectively.

Hearing on the Facts

[3]

The charges against the Student were as follows:

BIO 210 Charges
1. On or about November 13, 2012, you knowingly forged, or in any other way
altered or falsified a document that was required by the University, or you
knowingly uttered, circulated or made use of a forged, altered or falsified
document when you submitted an altered version of your Term Test #1 in
BIO 210 for re-marking, contrary to section B.1.1 (a) of the Code.

2.

In the alternative, on or about November 13, 2012, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
advantage of any kind, by altering and submitting for re-marking a document
that you claimed was your Term Test #1 in BIO 210, contrary to section

B.1.3(b) of the Code.

3.

On or about November 13, 2012, you knowingly forged, or in any
other way altered or falsified a document that was required by the University,
or you knowingly uttered, circulated or made use of a forged, altered or

2

falsified document when you submitted an altered version of your Term Test
#3 in BIO 210 for re-marking, contrary to section B.l.1(a) of the Code.

4.

In the alternative, on or about November 13, 2012, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
advantage of any kind, by altering and submitting for re-marking a document
that you claimed was your Term Test #3 in BIO 210, contrary to section
B.l.3(b) of the Code.

CCT 314 Charges

On or about April 3, 2013, you knowingly submitted, without the

5.

knowledge and approval of the instructor to whom it was submitted, academic
work for which credit had previously been obtained in another course at the
University, namely, an essay titled "Lady Gaga and the Gaze," which you
submitted for academic credit in CCT 314, contrary to Section B.1.1 (e) of the
Code.

6.

In the alternative, on or about April 3, 2013, you knowingly
represented as your own any idea or expression of an idea or work of another
in an essay titled "Lady Gaga and the Gaze," which you submitted for
academic credit in CCT 314 contrary to Section B.1.1 (d) of the Code.

7.

In the alternative, on or about April 3, 2013, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in order to obtain academic credit

3

in an essay titled "Lady Gaga and the Gaze," which you submitted for
academic credit in CCT 314, contrary to Section B.l.3(b) of the Code.

[4]

The Student did not attend the hearing but sent a representative, Mr.
Guiyab, from Downtown Legal Services. The ASF and JSP signed by the
Student confirmed that the Student signed the documents freely and
voluntarily, knowing the potential consequences she faced. Mr. Guiyab
confirmed that he was authorized to speak on the Student's behalf in her
absence. Since the Student signed the ASF and JSP and sent a legal
representative to the hearing, the Tribunal determined that it was entitled
to proceed with the hearing in the Student's absence, where the Tribunal
could find that she had committed an act or acts of academic misconduct,
and could impose sanctions against her as set out in the Code.

[5]

Discipline counsel provided an overview of the ASF.

[6]

The Student, via the ASF, entered a guilty plea to all 7 charges. The
University agreed that if the Tribunal convicted the Student of charges 1,
3, 5 or 6, the University would withdraw charge 2, 4 and 7.

Decision of the Tribunal on Charges

[7]

Following deliberation, based on the facts set out in the ASF and a review
of the documents contained in a Joint Book of Documents ("JBD"), the
Tribunal accepted the Student's guilty plea. Consequently, the University
withdrew charge 2, 4 and 7; and the Student stood convicted on charges
1, 3, 5 and 6.

Penalty

[8]

The matter then continued with a hearing into the appropriate sanction.
As noted above, the University and the Student filed a JSP attached to
these Reasons as Appendix B.

[9]

Discipline counsel indicated that the jointly proposed sanction, which
included, inter a/ia, a 5-year suspension from the University, was at the
high end of the penalty range.

[1 OJ

An aggravating factor was that a mere three weeks after admitting guilt at
the Dean's Designate meeting with respect to academic misconduct in
BIO21 0Y5Y - Anatomy, the Student committed another academic offence
with respect to CCT314H5S - Representation.
The Student was
4

specifically cautioned by the professor in CCT314 about the hazards of
rewriting on the same topic.
[11]

Discipline Counsel also pointed out that the nature of the offences was not
one that could have been committed negligently. The Student also had a
prior offence in respect of BIO318, a course that she took in 2009. There,
the Student submitted lab reports containing text that was identical to lab
reports previously submitted by another student.

[12]

In terms of mitigating factors, Discipline Counsel noted the Student's
admission of guilt at the Dean's Designate meeting and her cooperation
with respect to the ASF and JSP.

[13]

The proposed sanction in this case would permit the Student to soon write
a deferred examination in RLG205H5 - Introduction to South Asian
Religions - which the Student did not write due to illness. The parties
submitted that it would not be appropriate to make the Student wait until
the completion of the proposed 5 year suspension before writing the
exam.

[14]

The panel reviewed a number of Tribunal decisions presented by the
parties. In the J. S. and the University of Toronto (Case No. 706; May 21,
2013) decision, the student was found guilty of one count of plagiarism
with respect to a final practicum report to obtain a Master of Public Health
degree. The student had two prior incidents that were treated as one prior
offence. The student cooperated with the discipline process through an
ASF and JSP and received a 4 year suspension. In the V. P. and the
University of Toronto (Case No. 699; August 21, 2013) decision, the
student resubmitted an assignment which was virtually identical to an
assignment that she had submitted a year earlier. Similar to the Student's
case before this panel, the student resubmitted the assignment, without
acknowledgment, following a decanal meeting where the student was
warned that another offence would be treated much more severely. The
student received a 4-year suspension.

[15]

Here the Student was found guilty of four charges and had one prior
offence.

[16]

The Student's representative submitted that the Student's participation in
and agreement with the ASF and JSP signified her taking responsibility for
her actions. Acceptance of the JSP would necessitate the Student waiting
at least 5 years to complete her degree.

[17]

The Tribunal agreed that there were no compelling reasons in this case for
departing from the sanction jointly suggested by the parties in the JSP.

5

[18]

In light of the facts of this case, the admission of guilt by the Student, and
the joint submission regarding penalty, the Tribunal accepts the JSP and
imposes the following sanction:
1. THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:

ca

1)

Ms.
shall receive a final grade of zero in BIO210Y5Y and
CCT314H5S;

2)

Ms.
shall be suspended from the University from the
date of this order until January 13, 2019, except that she
shall be permitted to write a special deferred examination in
RLG205H5 during the February 2014 special examination
period;

3)

A notation of this offence and sanction shall be placed on
Ms. ~ academic record and transcript from the date of
this order until she graduates from the University.

4)

This case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a
notice of this decision with the name of the student withheld.

5)

This panel shall remain seized to deal with any
implementation issues concerning the Student writing the
deferred examination in RLG205H5.

t:9's marks in Anatomy is included in the JBD at Tab 5.

On September 12, 2012, Ms.

Cl wrote to Dr. Krupa and requested that her answers to

Term Test I and Term Test II be regraded. A copy of this message is included in the JBD at Tab

cl claimed to have sent "countless" e-mail
messages to Dr. Krupa requesting a re-grade. Ms. cl admits that this claim was not true.

(a)

Term Test I: Tab 7

(b)

Term Test Ill: Tab 8

Doc 1025393 v1

i 3.

Cl advised Ms. Du that, if she received the marks that she felt she deserved for

Ms.

Term Test I and 111, she would pass Anatomy and would be eligible to graduate in November
2013. Ms.

Cl stated that she was "just looking for 50% to pass the course" so that she could

graduate.
14.

The Teaching Assistants who marked Ms.

tests that Ms.

cas

Term Tests then examined the Term

cl had provided to Ms. Du. They concluded that the writing style of the answers

was quite different in different areas of the tests. In addition, a number of questions that Ms.

ct

claimed were not marked contained answers that were very similar to the answer keys that had
been distributed.
15.

Ms.

Cl admits that she altered Term Test I and Term Test Ill and knowingly submitted

them for re-grading:
(a)

in order to obtain an academic advantage;

(b)

to mislead the University and its staff and faculty by representing that they

were her original , unaltered tests; and
(c)

expecting that the University and its staff and faculty would rely on this

information to their detriment and would provide her with an academic
advantage.
16.

Ms.

ct specifically admits that:

(a)

on Term Test I, she added text to answer Question 1A, Question 1C, and
Question 3A; and

(b)

Doc 1025393 v1

on Term Test II, she added text to answer Question 2D.

Cl met with Professor Scott Graham, Dean's Designate for

Academic Integrity at the University of Toronto Mississauga to discuss the allegations that she

Cl was accompanied by a representative from Downtown Legal
Services. During this meeting, Ms. Cl admitted that she had committed the academic offences
described above. A copy of the written admission of guilt that Ms. Cl signed on that day is

had violated the Code. Ms.

Plagiarism in CCT 314

18.

In Winter 2013, Ms.

Cl enrolled in CCT314H5S - Representation in Language, Mind

and Art ("Representation"), which was taught by Dr. Anil Narine. A copy of the course outline for
Representation is found in the JBD at Tab 10.
19.

The assessment in Representation included a Final Paper, which was worth 35% of the

final grade. The paper was due on April 3, 2013, approximately three weeks after Ms.

Cl met

with Professor Graham to admit that she had committed academic offences in Anatomy.
20.

On or about April 3, 2013, Ms.

Cl submitted an essay titled "Lady Gaga and the Gaze"

for academic credit in Representation ("Lady Gaga Paper"). A highlighted copy of the Lady
Gaga Paper is Ms.
21.

Cl is included in the JBD Tab 11 .

The teaching assistant in Representation graded the Lady Gaga Paper. She noticed that

its content was very similar to a paper submitted previously in a different course, CCT 210 in
Summer 2011 . Further investigation located a copy of the paper Ms.

Cl submitted in CCT 201 ,

which was titled "The Modern Gaze". A copy of The Modern Gaze is included in the JBD at Tab
12.

22.

Before submitting the Lady Gaga Paper Ms.

Cl discussed The Modern Gaze in a

meeting with Dr. Narine. Dr. Narine emphasized the hazards of using the same topic twice. Ms.

Doc 1025393 v 1

Cl advised him that she would be answering a different research question and using a different
thesis. On that basis, Dr. Narine indicated that Ms.

Cl could proceed to write a paper in a

similar area as the Modern Gaze.

23. ·

Lengthy passages of the Lady Gaga Paper are taken verbatim, or nearly verbatim, from

the Modern Gaze. There is very little original scholarship in the Lady Gaga Paper and it

Cl admits that this is not what Dr. Narine
approved that she could do with the second paper. Ms. Cl acknowledges that by submitting the
contained no reference to the Modern Gaze. Ms.

Lady Gaga Paper she knowingly submitted:
(a)

academic work for which credit had previously been obtained in another course
in the University, without the knowledge and approval of the instructor to whom it
was submitted, contrary to section B.1.1(e) of the Code; and

(b)

work in which she represented as her own an idea or expression of an idea or
work of another, contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code.

Dear Ms.

RE: Academic Dishonesty - .BI03 l 8Y5 Assignment, Spring 20 l 0

I refer to the academic offence which occutTed during a recent assignment for BI0318Y5 brought to my
attention by Dr. Darryl Gwynne, course instructor.

In your interview with Dr. Gwynne on April 27, 2010, you admitted to copying (from a previous year's
marked assignment) and submitting for grading parts of two different lab reports, which constitutes use of
an unauthorized source. Under section C.I.(a) 8 of the University's Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters, (available on line at: http://www.utoronto.ca/govcncl/pap/policies/behaveac.html), I therefore
impose a sanction of a grade zero (0) for these course components ofBI0318YS.

I trust that you have had time to reflect on the seriousness of this incident and will not commit another
academic offence. If you have any questions regarding this sanction, please feel free to contact my office.
Sincerely,

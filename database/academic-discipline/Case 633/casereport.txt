Plea:

33.

The Student attended the hearing, was represented by counsel, and

entered a plea of guilty to 20 of the 32 charges above. The Student pied guilty to
the following charges: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26,
28, 30 and 31. The remaining 12 charges were not proceeded upon and were, in
effect, withdrawn by the University. The Student's plea of guilty was accepted by
the Tribunal.
Agreed Statement of Facts & Finding on Charges:

34.

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the University

had entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts with the Student. The Agreed
Statement of Facts is attached as Appendix A to this Decision. The Tribunal also
received into evidence, on consent, a Book of Documents containing documents
referred to in the Agreed Statement of Facts.
35.

As set out in more detail in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the

circumstances giving rise to the charges involved multiple occasions where the
Student applied by petition for permissions to write deferred exams. She filed
such petitions dated May 9, 2008, August 17, 2008, December 12, 2008, August

12

21, 2009, December 18, 2009 and April 29, 2012. The Student filed various
documentations in support of each of the petitions. The Student admits that each
of the Petitions contained, to her knowledge, false information and that the
documents submitted in support of the Petitions were knowingly forged and/or
altered and/or falsified and contained false information and that she knowingly
uttered, used and circulated these Petitions and supporting documents knowing
that they contained false information. A more detailed list of the falsified Petitions
and documents is contained at paragraph 41 of the Agreed Statement of Facts.
36.

After reviewing the facts contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and

Book of Documents, the Tribunal deliberated and concluded that the facts
demonstrated that the charges to which the Student had entered a plea of guilty,
as listed in paragraph 34 hereof, were proven. The Tribunal agreed to accept the
guilty pleas in respect of those charges. As above stated, the remaining charges
were, in effect, withdrawn. A finding of guilt was entered to the charges to which
pleas of guilty had been made.
Penalty:
37.

The parties submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty to the Tribunal. The

Joint Submission is attached as Appendix B. The Joint Submission proposed
that the Student be given a final grade of zero in each of the courses which were
the subject of the charges to which pleas of guilty had been entered, that she be
suspended from the University commencing March 22, 2012 and ending March
21, 2017, and that a notation of the sanction be made on her academic record
and transcript until the earlier of her graduation from the University or March 21,
2019. The Joint Submission further stated that it would be appropriate for the
Tribunal to report the case to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
Tribunal's Decision and the sanctions imposed in the University newspapers,
with the name of the student withheld.

13

38.

In oral submissions, counsel for the University emphasized that the

offences were of the most egregious sort, involving multiple instances of
repeated conduct and, indeed, a pattern of conduct designed to violate the Code.
She indicated that, but for the Student's co-operation, an even heavier penalty
would have been appropriate. She pointed out that the distinction between a five
year suspension and expulsion from the University is that the suspension allows
the student "one last chance, if she wishes to take it".
39.

In oral submissions, counsel for the Student emphasized that the Student

takes complete responsibility for her actions and acknowledges her
responsibility. He submitted that she has been seriously impacted by her
actions, has been under significant stress and carries a stigma that is attached to
her actions. The Student intends to conduct herself in an ethical manner in the
future and appreciates the opportunity and potential to reform herself. She
recognizes that the University must maintain the integrity of its academic
processes and of its academic degrees. He further stated that, of her own
initiative, she intends to engage in counselling.

40.

The Student, herself, stated that she was very sorry for her actions, that

she made a serious mistake and that she is grateful for the further opportunity
afforded by the Joint Submission on Penalty.

41.

The Tribunal considered the factors that govern its decision, particularly

those set out in The University of Toronto and Mr. C, dated November 5, 1976, at
pp. 12 (file no. 1976/77-3).

42.

The proven charges are very serious, particularly the Student's knowing

falsification of petitions for academic favour and the use of elaborate forged or
falsified documents in support of the false petitions. The Student submitted the
false petitions and provided the false information and/or falsified documents to
the University to obtain an academic advantage, and expected that the falsified

14

documents would be relied upon by the University to allow her the academic
advantage.
43.

The Tribunal recognizes the Student's co-operation and, further,

recognizes that the Student has no prior discipline history, has shown remorse ,
and has pledged to conduct herself ethically and not to repeat this conduct.
44.

While the Tribunal has taken these mitigating factors into account, absent

the Joint Submission, the Tribunal would have given serious consideration to a
more severe penalty. The pattern of elaborate falsehood , undertaken
deliberately to obtain academic advantage, is antithetical to the core values
expected of students as set out in the Code. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal
recognizes the high threshold that must be met for the Tribunal to reject a joint
submission. That is, the Tribunal would have to be of the view that accepting the
joint submission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute

(University of Toronto , dated June 10, 2011, at para. 8). (Case no. 642). The
Tribunal concluded that accepting the Joint Submission in this case would not
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

45.

The Tribunal, therefore, accepted the Joint Submission on Penalty.

Decision of the Tribunal:
46.

The Tribunal issued the following Order:

1.

THAT Ms.

'ti is guilty of thirteen counts of forging, altering and

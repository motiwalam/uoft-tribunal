Preliminary

[1]

The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on September
24, 2012 to consider charges under the University of Toronto Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (the "Code") laid against the
Student by letter dated April 26, 2012 from Professor Edith Hillan, ViceProvost, Faculty and Academic Life.

[21

The Student and the University entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts
("ASF") and a Joint Submission on Penalty ("JSP"), copies of which are
attached to these Reasons as Appendix "A" and "B" respectively.

Hearing on the Facts

[3J

The charges against the Student were as follows:
1. You knowingly forged, or in any other way altered or falsified an
academic record, and/or uttered, circulated or made use of such
forged, altered or falsified record, namely, a document labelled
"Registration History" that purported to be your academic history and
unofficial transcript from the University of Toronto, contrary to Section
B.1.3.(a) of the Code.
Discipline Counsel provided an overview of the ASF.

[4]

The Student, via the ASF, entered a guilty plea to charge 1.

Decision of the Tribunal on Charges

[5]

Following deliberation, based on the facts set out in the ASF and a review
of the documents contained in a Joint Book of Documents ("JBD"), the
Tribunal accepted the Student's guilty plea on charge 1. Consequently,
the Student stood convicted on charge 1.

Penalty

[6]

The matter then continued with a hearing into the appropriate sanction.
As noted above, the University and the Student filed a JSP attached to
these Reasons as Appendix B.

[7]

Discipline counsel noted that transcript forgery is among the most serious
of academic misconduct offences. However, the Student cooperated from
the outset of the discipline process and that the misconduct in question
2

had transpired very quickly. The JSP proposed, inter alia, a five-year
suspension from the University. Discipline Counsel also presented a
number of Tribunal decisions and submitted that the penalty in the JSP
was consistent with those decisions.
[8]

The Student read from a statement and expressed contrition regarding his
conduct. Counsel for the Student did not elaborate on the Student's
statement.

[9]

The panel noted that the misconduct herein involved the Student providing
a falsified academic transcript to an employer. Employers and other third
parties must be able to rely on University transcripts as accurate in order
to make objective hiring decisions. The Student's misconduct strikes at
the very integrity of the recruitment process.

The misconduct has the

potential, as it did here, of not only having an undeserving candidate
receive a job offer, but, in effect, taking that job offer away from more
deserving candidates. The Student's cooperation in the discipline process
throughout provided an optimistic indicator that the Student's relationship
with the University could still be restored. The panel concluded that the
penalty proposed in the JSP was consistent with the serious nature of the
Student's misconduct and that there was no principled reason to reject it.
[1 0]

In light of the facts of this case, the admission of guilt by the Student, and
the joint submission regarding penalty, the Tribuna l accepts the JSP and
imposes the following sanction:
1. THAT Mr. ~ be suspended from the University from
September 24, 2012, to September 23, 2017;
2. THAT the sanction shall be recorded on Mr. ~
•s academic
record and transcript from the date of this order until September 23,
2019;and
3. THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction
imposed , with the name of the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto, this 16th day of July, 2013.

IN THE MATTER OF charges of academic dishonesty made on April 26, 2012;
AND IN THE MATTER OF the University ofToronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995,
AND IN THE MATTER OF the University of Toronto Act, 1971, S .O. 1971, c. 56 as am. S .0 . 1978, c. 88

BETWEEN:

THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
-AND-

AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS

1.

This hearing arises out of charges of academic misconduct filed by the Provost of the

University of Toronto (the "Provost") under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters
("Code"). For the purposes of this hearing, the Provost and ~ -

~ ("Mr. ~

")

have prepared this Ag reed Statement of Facts ("ASF") and a joint book of documents ("JBD").
The Provost and Mr. ~ agree that:

(a)

each document contained in the JBD may be admitted into evidence before the
Tribunal for all purposes, including for the truth of the document's contents,
without further need to prove the document; and

(b)

if a document indicates that it was sent or received by someone, that is prima

facie proof that the document was sent and received as indicated.

A.

Notice of hearing, charges and guilty plea

2.

Mr. ~ admits that on August 10, 2012, he received a notice of hearing for

September 24, 2012, and that he received reasonable notice of the hearing. The notice of
hearing is included in the JBD at Tab 1.

3.

Mr. ~ admits that he received a copy of the charge filed by the Provost, which is

found in the JBD at Tab 2. Mr. ~ waives the reading of the charge filed against him, and
hereby pleads guilty to charge #1.
4.

At all material times, Mr. ~

was a registered student at the University of Toronto. A

true copy of his academic record, dated September 19, 2012, is found in the JBD at Tab 3.

B.

Admissions

5.

In Winter 2012, Mr. ~

applied for a position as a Risk Management Intern at Swiss

Re, a large re-insurance firm ("Company"). He submitted a cover letter and resume. He did not
submit a transcript at the time of his application, as he was not required to do so.

6.

Mr. ~ received an interview with the Company. During that interview, the Company

told him that the successful candidate would have a grade point average ("GPA") of 3.5 or
higher. Mr. ~ knew that he did not have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. Mr. ~ was invited for a
second interview. Mr. ~ received an offer of employment.
7.

On March 29, 2012, Jennifer M. Menezes, Assistant Vice President, Human Resources,

sent an employment letter to Mr. ~

- Later that evening, Mr. ~ signed the em ployment

letter and returned it to Ms. Menezes. As part of accepting the job offer, the company required
Mr. ~ to consent to the disclosure of personal information for a background check, which
he did.

8.

On March 30, 2012, at 06:51, Ms. Menezes wrote to M r . ~ and stated "In order to

complete your file kindly send me a copy of your transcripts as well."
9.

Four hours later, at 11 :04, Mr. ~ wrote an e-mail to Ms. Menezes stating "Hi Jenny,

the transcript is attached in PDF document". A copy of the document submitted by Mr. ~

is

included in the JBD at Tab 4.
10.

Meanwhile, at 10:09, on March 30, 2012, Mr. ~

·s roommate, Jeffrey Jin Kang, sent

an e-mail to Ms. Menezes. Mr. Kang had also applied for the job that had been offered to Mr.

838831 _2.DOC

----- -- --- - _ ______'"""".. . .,. . . ,......-.. . =~-~----====-=--.. . . ====

~ - Mr. Kang advised Ms. Menezes that Mr. ~ did not have a GPA of 3.50 and that he
had misrepresented his GPA to the Company.

11.

After receiving the e-mail , Ms. Menezes contacted the Career Services Office at Rotman

and then sent Mr. ~ • s "transcript" to Rotman. The Rotman staff checked Mr. ~ • s official
record and concluded that he had altered some grades as well as his grade point averages.

12.

Tiffany Smye, assistant director, career services at Rotman, contacted Mr. ~ and

asked him to meet with her on Friday afternoon . Mr. ~ attended the meeting and admitted
that he had provided a forged or falsified transcript to the Company. At the end of the meeting,
Mr. ~ voluntarily sent a copy of his official transcript to the Company. Mr. ~ apologized
to the Company for misleading them and for any inconvenience that he had caused. After
receiving the official transcript, the Company revoked the job offer.

13.

On April 11, 2012, Mr. ~ met with the Dean's Designate for Academic Integrity

through the Office of Student Academic Integrity in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Mr. ~
admitted that he had provided an altered transcript to Swiss Re. Mr. ~ stated that he knew
he was misleading Swiss Re by allowing his name to stand as a candidate for the position
knowing that he did not have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or better. However, he stated that he had
no intention of providing a forged or falsified document to the Company when he first applied for
the job. He was surprised to receive the job offer and panicked when Ms. Menezes required him
to submit a transcript.

14.

On April 23, 2012, the Dean's Designate for Academic Integrity forwarded the case to

the Provost to consider laying a charge under the Code. A copy of that letter is included in the
JBD at Tab 5.

15.

Mr. ~ admits that he forged and falsified his academic record in at least 23 ways.

He increased the marks and letter grades in 6 courses that he completed. He increased every
sessional and cumulative grade point average that he had earned from 2010 Summer onward.
He hid the fact that he had taken ECO 326 and received a final grade of 54%.

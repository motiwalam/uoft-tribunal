a joint submission in which you pled guilty to charges 1, 3, 5 and 7, with charges 2, 4, 6 and 8
being disregarded. The Panel accepted this joint submission.
Counsel for the University and your Counsel then made a joint recommendation with respect to
sanction. After deliberation, the Panel accepted the joint recommendation/submission of the
parties and imposed the following sanctions:
•

assignment of a grade of zero in each of the three courses (PHY A10F,
MGT A02Y, and ECO A03Y);

•

suspension from the University for four years, effective July 1, 2000; and

•

that the sanction of suspension be noted on your academic record and transcript for a
period of five years, commencing July 1, 2000.

The Tribunal also recommended that this case be reported to the Provost, who may publish a
notice of the decision in the University newspapers, with your name withheld.
The Panel provided the following reasons for its decision.
By way of reasons, the Panel concurs that the students has pled guilty to very serious offences - they were repeated, they had a pattern of being deliberate and pre-determined and so it
agrees that sanctions at the severe end of the scale are warranted. However, the matter has
been resolved short of a lengthy hearing and in view of the pattern and the previous penalties
imposed, the Panel is prepared to accept the joint submission of the parties.
Yours sincerely,
Margaret McKone

Trial Division – s. B.i.1(b) of Code – unauthorized assistance – Student knowingly used or possessed an unauthorized aid, or aids, or obtained unauthorized assistance in connection with two assignments – Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) – admission of guilt – the Student admitted to accessing Chegg.com – finding of guilt – Agreed Statement of Fact on Sanction – four prior academic offences – Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”) – the Panel did not recommend expulsion in this case as there was no proof that the Student paid for access to Chegg.com and the Student did eventually cooperate with the University in this matter – the proposed penalty is serious and lengthy – the Panel accepted that the JSP was reasonable and within the range of appropriate sanctions for the offences the Student committed – a grade of zero in the course; a suspension of just under five years; a six-year notation or until graduation on the transcript, whichever comes first; and a report to the Provost for publication.

Charges and Appearances

I.

The Trial Division of the Tribunal heard this matter on August 15, 2016. The Student
was charged on February 22, 2016 with 11 charges, including plagiarism and use of
unauthorized assistance relating to the following courses/evaluations:
(a)

FAH 319HlF ("FAH319")- research paper on or about August 9, 2015 Charges

(b)

F AH 319 - final examination on August 13, 2015 (Charges 3 and 4);

(c)

GGR 361H1F ("GGR361") - final examination on August 17, 2015 (Charge 6
and 7); and

(d)

GGR 328HlF "(GGR328")- final examination on December 16, 2015 (Charge 9
and 10).

The Student was also charged, in the alternative in each of the above courses, with
engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code.
2.

The Student attended at the hearing with representation from Downtown Legal Services.

3.

The Student and University tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts ("ASF") for a guilty
plea.

Facts

4.

The Student wrote three (3) final examinations in the courses in the fall term of 2015. In
each case, the Office of Student Academic Integrity in the Faculty of A1is and Science
("OSAI") reviewed the Student's examination booklets.

OSAI identified verbatim or

nearly verbatim excerpts from a number of internet sources without proper citation.
5.

The Student has admitted to the following in the ASF:

2

(a)

In FAH319, GGR361 and GGR328, she knowingly included uncited verbatim or
near verbatim excerpts from external sources and represented them as her own in
each of the respective final examinations; and

(b)

she committed plagiarism contrary to section B.1.l(d) of the Code; and

(c)

she engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit, contrary to section B.I.3(b)
of the Code.

Decision of the Tribunal
6.

Based on the ASF and the panel's review of the examination booklets in question along
with the University's identification of the plagiarized source material, the Student is
found guilty of plagiarism contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code relating to the final
examinations in FAH319, GGR361 and GGR328, namely Charges 3, 6 and 9.

7.

The University withdrew Charges 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11.

Penalty
8.

The Student and University submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts relating to Penalty
("ASFP") and a Joint Submission on Penalty ("JSP") for the following penalty:
(a)

a zero in Courses FAH3 l 9, GGR361 and GGR328;

(b)

a four (4) year suspension from the University commencing the date of the Order;
and

(c)

a five (5) year notation of the sanction on the Student's academic record and
transcript until her graduation from the University.

9.

The Student has two prior sanctions relating to academic misconduct since attending the
University in 2011:

3

(a)

m 20 I 1, the Student admitted to committing plagiarism in an assignment m
INI 11 5 and received a zero for the assignment and a course grade reduction of 25
marks; and

(b)

in 2014, the Student admitted to committing plagiarism in an assignment m
EV222 1 and received a final grade of zero in the course and an 8 month
suspension from September 1, 20 14 to April 30, 2015 .

10.

On each of these prior occasions of misconduct, the Student received a written sanction
letter which warned her to avoid future plagiarism and a warning that any further offence
would attract very serious consequences.

11.

Unfortunately, the Student has appeared to not only ignore the sentiment m these
Sanction letters but has also committed plagiarism for much more significant evaluations,
being the final examinations of each course.

12.

The University and Student's agent both hi ghlighted the Student's cooperation and guilty
plea which undoubtedly figured into the JSP which the Panel finds , in the circumstances,
to be lenient. Without the JSP, the Panel would have been inclined to order a greater
penalty.

13 .

After a cursory review of the

cllll factors (Case No . 1976/77-3 , November 5, 1976),

the Tribunal accepts the terms of penalty set out in the JSP .
14.

An Order was signed at the hearing by the Panel to this effect.

15.

The Tribunal is to report this decision to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed in the University's newspapers, with
the name of the Student withheld .

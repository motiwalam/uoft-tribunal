Transcription of Oral Reasons On Sanction Delivered by the Chair at the
Conclusion of the Hearing

(I]

With some considerable reluctance, the Panel has decided it will accept the joint
recommendation of the University and your counsel to impose this sanction which
is essentially a three-year suspension, but in doing so, we want you to know that
while this was an unusual case, it was in no way, shape, or form an insignificant one
or small one or a minor maner. We see it as a major maner.

(2]

We see your conduct in the course of many years to be nothing less than deliberate
acts of dishonesty, forgery, and a continued failure to recognize what you have
done. Not only that, but your acts embroiled a fellow student in acts of academic
dishonesty himself, which had to be sorted out and who knew how that would tum
out. We noted that this has been going on since the year 2007 for him, and that as
late as March 2009 you made no admission that you had done anything wrong.

[3]

You have ambitions to go to law school and we want you to know that the
university expects integrity and honesty from students in all things, and that you did
not display that standard of conduct during this long period of time.

(4]

So we are concerned and remain concerned, but as was pointed out to us, we have a
limited ability to overturn an agreed submission on penalty. And in this case, we
were not persuaded in the end that agreeing with the joint submission would bring
the administration of this tribunal into disrepute, which is the test that we would
have had to meet. But it's a close call, I can tell you. So you should consider
yourself fortunate.

(5]

And we took into account in reaching our decision the character references which
we put some weight on. These are people who have known you for many years,
and certainly attest to your good qualities. Other important considerations were that
we think your apology was sincere and that you are getting some counselling and
that your family is now inside the tent and can provide you with direction and the
help that I think you will need.

[6]

On a more technical side, our being here tonight with an agreed statement of facts
and a plea from you did save the university and other people including wlr. Kai
what would have been a lengthy and difficult hearing. We now know that wlr.
is not going to face charges, and that was a factor.

K-

[7]

In this particular case, we put some emphasis on the fact that Ms. Harmer was
prepared to make this recommendation on behalf of the university.

[8]

So we will impose the sanction that is provided for in Exhibit 2.

2

[9]

l)

The Student shall be suspended from the university for that two-year
period, starting tomorrow, September 29, 2009.

2)

There will be a notation on the Student's record and n·anscript until the
Student graduates, which will be sooner than the three years in the
second element of it

3)

The Tribunal shall report the case to the Provost for publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions
imposed in the University newspapers with the name of the student
withheld.

When you pursue your next academic endeavours and your endeavours in life,
please keep this lesson in mind, because I think you have been given every
advantage by your counsel, the university, and by this tribunal.

I certify that this is the decision of the Panel

2.

On August 27, 2009, the University delivered a Notice of Hearing in this matter.

This Notice of Hearing is found at Tab 1 of the JB0.
3.

The Notice of Hearing arises out of charges of academic misconduct filed by the

Provost under the Code. A copy of the Charges is found in the JB0 at Tab 2.

P . 0 - admits that she is guilty of academic misconduct as set out in

Charges 1 and 6.

In November 2005 Ms. D - began dating

PIii R_K_, a student at the

In or around October, 2006, Ms. D - and Mr.

K - broke up. Their relationship was on again off again until late winter/early spring
of 2007; however, they were still in communication after their final break-up.
7.

In October, 2006, Ms. D . told Mr. K-that she was sick, and had been sick

for a number of years. She further told him that she did not want anyone to know about
her illness, not even her family, that he was the only person she had ever told about it,
and that he was not to tell anyone. She further told him that she was undergoing tests
to determine a diagnosis. An email exchange between Ms. D . and Mr. K - on
October 24, 2006 concerning these issues is found in the JBD at Tab 4.
8.

On or about November 9, 2006, Ms. D - told Mr.

diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

KIii that she had been

She further told him not to tell anyone about her

illness, as she wanted to keep it a secret from everyone, including her friends and
family. She told Mr. K - that he would be her sole support in helping her to deal with
her fight with cancer.

9.

Ms. D . wrote and gave to Mr. K - a letter dated November 8, 2006 which

she told him was from her family doctor, Dr. Janette Milne ("November 8, 2006 Letter").
This letter had the name Janet Milne PhD typewritten at the bottom, and stated that Ms.

D - was ill with cancer, that she would be undergoing further tests, and that she
needed to tell someone about her medical situation to obtain personal support during
the treatment process.

It further stated that she may be entering chemotherapy in

November 2006. A copy of the November 8, 2006 Letter is found in the JBD at Tab 5.
10.

Shortly thereafter Ms. D - gave to Mr. K - a series of letters she had written

to him, in which she referenced, among other things, the impact of a cancer diagnosis
on her outlook on life, her concerns about the future, and her love for Mr. i<a. In
particular she suggested a number of times that she did not have a long future to look
forward to, and once stated that she was dying. An email from Mr. K - to Ms. D .
dated November 13, 2006 summarizing some of the contents of these letters is found in
the JBD at Tab 6.
11.

Ms. D . wanted to persuade Mr. K-that she was seriously ill with cancer.

Her motive for doing so was an effort to save a failing relationship. She believed that if
she convinced Mr. K - that she was ill, he would continue to be her boyfriend and

n

they would rebuild their relationship.

Mr. K - told Ms. D - that he was very worried about her health and that the

resulting stress was impacting on his school work. He told her that he was considering
asking for relief from his course instructors in the form of a deferral of his end of term
deadlines for course work.

Ms. D-states that she did not give Mr.

the purpose of submitting it to the University, and that she only became aware that he
had done so after the fact when he asked her to provide him with additional medical
documentation as discussed in paragraph 17 below .
15.

After learning that the November 8, 2006 Letter had been submitted by Mr.

K - to the University, Ms. D . did not tell Mr. K - that she had fabricated the
November 8, 2006 Letter, nor did she tell anyone else .
16.

Ms. D - further states that at the time (early December 2006) she was only

aware that the November 8, 2006 Letter had been submitted to Todd Sanders for
ANT360; she became aware much later that he had also submitted it to his course

intended to submit the

December 5, 2006 Note to Todd Sanders for ANT360, and became aware some time
later that he had also submitted it to Heather Miller for ANT316.

This note, which

contained Dr. Janet Milne's signature, stated that Ms. D-was extremely ill, that she
required support from a peer as her family had not been made aware of her illness, and
that Ms. D•'s condition was confidential. A copy of the December 5, 2006 Note is

19.

Ms. D - was aware that Mr.

K-

intended to request an extension in his

course work because of his belief that she was suffering from a serious medical
condition. She was aware that he believed the contents of the November 8, 2006 Letter
to be true. She did not disabuse him of this belief. She admits that she ought to have
known that there was a strong likelihood that he would use this letter in support of his
requests for extensions to his course deadlines.
20.

Ms. D - states that she did not tell Mr.

K-

the truth because she wanted to

K.,

maintain the relationship, which became her singular focus, and she did not at the time
appreciate the seriousness of the consequences to herself, to Mr.

Todd Sanders confirmed with Dr. Janette Milne that neither the November 8,

2006 Letter nor the December 5, 2006 Note (collectively the "Doctors Notes") were
written by her. Despite knowing this, and despite knowing that as a consequence Mr.
K-was facing allegations of academic misconduct, Ms. O-continued to mislead

R-Kallinto believing that she had cancer which required medical treatment. She
further misled him into thinking that the information contained in the Doctors Notes was
true, and that Dr. Milne was not telling the truth.
23.

Ms. 0 - further assisted Mr. ~ to prepare to attend two meetings with the

dean's designate under section C.l.(a).5. of the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters by providing him with documents to support his belief that she was suffering
from cancer, including additional medical documentation about her medical status. A
copy of an email from P-Dl!l to RIii K - dated April 2, 2007, together with the
related supporting documents, is found at Tab 12 of the JBD. Another email from P D . to R 24.

KIii dated April 4, 2007 at 12:20 p.m is found in the JBD at Tab 13.

Mr. K - attended a first dean's meeting on April 4, 2007 at 2:00 p.m., to

address allegations that he submitted the Doctors Notes in order to seek academic
consideration for term work not yet submitted in ANT360.

Mr. ~ used the

information provided to him by Ms. O-to defend himself, and to support his assertion
that Ms. 0 - was and had been sick. Ms. D . continued to tell Mr. ~ and
believes that at this time he continued to believe, that she was seriously ill with cancer,
and she actively supplied him with information to support that belief.

27.

During the period from December 18, 2006 to March 27, 2009, Ms. D-was in

periodic communication with Sally Walker, Assistant Principal and Registrar at New

K-

College, regarding her personal issues. Initially she told Ms. Walker that her boyfriend
R-

had been wrongly accused of an academic offence, and that she had

ovarian cancer.

From time to time she continued to discuss these issues with Ms.

Walker, maintaining the story that she had been diagnosed with cancer and that she

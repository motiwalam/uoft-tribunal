reflection paper, which was worth 15% of the final grade, a first assignment worth

16.

On August 16, 2012, you submitted your reflection paper and the two

In Summer 2012, you also enrolled in POL 410, which was called Topics

in Comparative Policies Ill: Peasants in the Global Political Economy, and which

4

18.

As one of the requirements of POL 410, you were required to submit a

research essay, which was worth 40% of the final grade.
19.

On August 21, 2012, you submitted an essay titled "Are Modifications to

Gender and Land Reform Policies Achievable Answers for Agrarian Change?"
20.

You knowingly submitted each piece of academic work:
(a)

to obtain academic credit;

(b)

knowing that it contained verbatim or nearly verbatim passages
from other sources, which were not placed in quotation marks or
properly attributed to their original sources;

(c)

knowing that it contained ideas or expressions of ideas which were
not your own;

(d)

without including the actual sources you used in your bibliography;

(e)

knowing that it contained references to sources that were
concocted or/and that you did not consult in order to obtain an
academic advantage and for the purpose of attempting to conceal
your plagiarism; and

(f)

with the intention that the University of Toronto rely on it as your
own ideas in determining the appropriate academic credit to be
assigned to the work.

[4]

Discipline Counsel provided an overview of the ASF.

[5]

The Student, via the ASF, entered a guilty plea to charges 1, 4, 7 and 10.
The University withdrew the remaining charges.

5

Decision of the Tribunal on Charges

[6]

Following deliberation, based on the facts set out in the ASF and a review
of the documents contained in a Joint Book of Documents ("JBD"}, the
Tribunal accepted the Student's guilty plea on the charges. Consequently,
the Student stood convicted on charges 1, 4, 7 and 10.

Penalty

[7]

The matter then continued with a hearing into the appropriate sanction.
As noted above, the University and the Student filed a JSP attached to
these Reasons as Appendix B.

[8]

Discipline Counsel noted that plagiarism is a serious academic
misconduct offence. A first conviction of plagiarism generally results in a
minimum 2-year suspension from the University. Here the Student was
being sanctioned for academic misconduct offences that occurred in two
time periods: the present offences under charges 1, 4, 7 and 10 that
occurred in August 2012; and a prior offence in Fall 2010, where the
Student committed plagiarism in an assignment worth 10% of the final
grade.

[9]

The Student cooperated by admitting her misconduct with respect to
POL381 at the Dean's Designate meeting although she continued to deny
wrongdoing with respect to POL410 at that stage. Subsequently, the
Student cooperated fully with the University by agreeing to the ASF and
JSP with respect to both the POL381 and POL410 courses. Discipline
counsel suggested that the Student's ultimate admission of her
misconduct and full cooperation, though late in the process, indicated a
prospect of rehabilitation that permitted the parties to agree on a sanction
that was significant, albeit not at the most serious end of the penalty
spectrum.

[1 O]

The JSP proposed, inter alia, a four-year suspension from the University.
Discipline Counsel also presented a number of Tribunal decisions and
submitted that the penalty in the JSP was consistent with those decisions.
Discipline Counsel reminded the Tribunal that it should show deference to
the JSP unless very strong reasons existed to depart from the joint
submission such as that adherence to the proposed penalty would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.

[11]

Counsel for the Student echoed the University's submission that a JSP
has a very high persuasive value and should not generally be disturbed.
Student's Counsel also indicated that the proposed four-year suspension,

6

coming as it did at a point when the Student had fulfilled all her
requirements and was ready to graduate, was a significant penalty.

(12]

The panel noted that the misconduct herein involved wholesale plagiarism
and non-attribution of work. The August 2012 multiple charges for which
the Student stood convicted represented a second occasion that the
Student had engaged in plagiarism. Troublingly, the Student did not come
clean at the Dean's Designate meeting, still offering an unlikely defence
for the POL410 paper. The Student's explanation was completely at odds
with fairly obvious evidence of her plagiarism.
Still, the Student
cooperated fully with the ultimate disciplinary process that resulted in this
hearing.

[13]

The panel concluded that the penalty proposed in the JSP was consistent
with the serious nature of the Student's misconduct and that there was no
principled reason to reject it. In any event, the proposed sanction was
consistent with the Tribunal's jurisprudence.

[14]

In light of the facts of this case, the admission of guilt by the Student, and
the joint submission regarding penalty, the Tribunal accepts the JSP and
imposes the following sanction:

1.

THAT Ms. ~ is found guilty of four counts of the academic

offence of plagiarism, contrary to section B.l.1(d) of the Code of Behaviour on
Academic Matters;

2.

THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on Ms. ~ :
(a)

she shall receive a final grade of zero in each of the courses POL
381 and POL 410;

(b)

she shall be suspended from the University commencing August 7,
2013, for a period of 4 years; and

(c)

that a notation be placed on her academic record and transcript for
a period of five years from the date of this order;

7

3.

THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice

of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction imposed, with the
name of the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto, th is 26th day of September, 2013.

   The Student was charged underÂ ss.Â B.i.1(a) and
   B.i.1(b)Â ofÂ theâ¯Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters,
   1995â¯(âCodeâ) on the basis thatÂ a)Â he knowinglyâ¯falsified,
   circulated or made use ofÂ aÂ forged academicÂ record, namelyÂ a
   Scantron sheet thatÂ heÂ submitted in a midterm
   examination;Â andÂ b)Â heÂ knowingly obtained unauthorized assistance
   in connection withÂ thatÂ midterm examination.Â Alternatively,Â he was
   chargedÂ under s. B.i.3(b)Â of theÂ CodeÂ forÂ knowingly engagingÂ in a
   form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
   advantage of any kind in connection with a midterm examination.

   For theÂ examinationÂ in question,Â twoÂ differentÂ versionsÂ of the
   examÂ were distributedÂ (version A and version B)Â to reduce the
   potential for cheating.Â TheÂ StudentÂ received a version BÂ exam
   butÂ misrepresented on his Scranton form that he had received a version
   A exam.

   TheÂ PanelÂ delivered reasons for mid-hearing motions and evidentiary
   issues orally.Â First,Â theÂ Student sought to call his initialÂ legal
   representativeÂ to provide evidence regarding his observations of the
   distribution of answers across the exams that were completed for the
   mid-term.Â TheÂ PanelÂ did not permitÂ theÂ Student to call his initial
   legal representativeÂ as a witness.Â Instead,Â heÂ was allowed
   toÂ address theÂ representativeâsÂ proposedÂ observations and arguments
   as part of the closing submissions.Â Second,Â after the Student
   completed his evidence and the defence rested its case, the
   UniversityÂ requestedÂ an adjournment to call reply
   evidence.Â TheÂ PanelÂ granted theÂ adjournment on terms.Â It explained
   that while it was reasonable to argue that the University could have
   called the TAs as witnesses during their case in chief given their
   involvement in the events in question, the StudentÂ hadÂ chosenÂ to
   provide his explanation for the first time during his
   testimony.Â ItÂ acknowledged that itÂ wasÂ the StudentâsÂ rightÂ to do
   so,Â but thatÂ fairness dictated that the University be given an
   opportunity to call reply evidence.Â ToÂ negate any potential
   prejudice, theÂ PanelÂ imposedÂ the following terms:
   a)Â TheÂ University was instructed not to discuss the evidence at the
   hearing with the potential reply witnesses; b)Â Any reply evidence was
   strictly limited to true reply, that is, it had to be in response to
   evidence that was raised for the first time in the Studentâs testimony;
   c)Â The delay due to the adjournment was brief as all parties and
   counsel were accommodating and able to find a date within one week to
   resume the proceeding;Â andÂ d)Â The Student was given the opportunity
   to participate in the resumed hearing via videoconference. Since he had
   already testified, there was no impact on the quality of the
   evidenceÂ as a result ofÂ this
   accommodation.Â Finally,Â theÂ PanelÂ denied the Studentâs
   motionÂ seeking production of University counselâs notes of interviews
   conducted with the reply witnesses in between the hearing
   dates.Â TheÂ PanelÂ highlightedÂ theÂ general principle that notes
   prepared by counsel of interviews conducted in preparation for a
   hearing are subject to litigation privilege. The underlying facts are
   not subject to privilege;Â however, the notes themselves ordinarily
   will be. That applies even in a case such as this one where the
   University acknowledged that the discussions with the TAs in between
   the hearing dates were the first time that the potential witnesses were
   interviewed.Â ToÂ ensure that the Student had full disclosure of the
   underlying facts within the proposed reply witnessesâ knowledge, the
   University was ordered to review the counsel notes and to provide a
   summary of any additional facts that were not reflected in the âWill
   Sayâ summaries that had already been produced even if the additional
   facts were not evidence that the University intended to lead.

   TheÂ PanelÂ foundÂ the StudentÂ guilty ofÂ knowingly engaging in a form
   of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
   advantage of any kind in connection with the midterm examination,
   contrary to section B.i.3(b) of theÂ Code.Â However,Â itÂ wasÂ not
   convinced that the StudentÂ hadÂ cheated in the manner alleged by the
   UniversityÂ becauseÂ there was no direct evidence showing that
   heÂ hadÂ copied off another student at the exam.Â Furthermore,
   theÂ PanelÂ accepted the Universityâs submission that it did not have
   to prove exactly howÂ the Student cheatedÂ in order toÂ establish that
   an academic offence was committed.

   In determiningÂ the sanctions, theÂ PanelÂ consideredÂ theÂ following
   factors:Â theÂ StudentâsÂ prior offence;Â his
   submissionÂ concerningÂ his return to the University to complete his
   studies;Â the concernÂ regarding the possibility of the Student
   re-offendingÂ if he elected to immediately pursue graduate studies
   after graduation;Â the length of time that had passed between when the
   offence was committed andÂ whenÂ the matter was brought to a
   hearing.Â TheÂ PanelÂ alsoÂ notedÂ thatÂ it is expected that the
   discipline process will typically be much shorter since students should
   not be subjected to the stigma,Â uncertaintyÂ and stress of being
   charged any longer than necessary.

   TheÂ PanelÂ imposed the following sanctions:Â a grade of zero in the
   course; a suspensionÂ for just over 29 months; a 40 month notation on
   the transcript or until the date of graduation,Â whichever date is
   later;Â andÂ a report to the Provost for a publicationÂ with the
   Studentâs name withheld.

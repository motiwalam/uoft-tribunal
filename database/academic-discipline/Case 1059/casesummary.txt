   Grievances

   The Student was charged underâ¯s.Â B.i.1(a)Â of theâ¯Code of Behaviour
   on Academic Matters, 1995â¯(the âCodeâ) on the basis thatÂ the
   Studentâ¯knowingly forged or in any other way altered or falsified a
   document or evidence required by the University, or uttered, circulated
   or made use of such forged, altered or falsified document, namely
   aÂ midterm exam.Â In the alternative the Student was chargedÂ under s.
   B.i.3(b) of theÂ CodeÂ on the basis that sheÂ knowingly engaged in a
   form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to
   obtain academic credit or other academic advantage.

   The Panel received, heard,Â andÂ examined evidence ofâ¯the Professor
   who taughtâ¯the course for which theÂ midtermÂ was submitted, the
   Professorâs Teaching Assistant (âTAâ),Â an Academic Integrity
   Specialist, and the Student.Â The Professor, the TA,Â and the Academic
   Integrity SpecialistÂ provided their evidence by way of affidavit,
   which the Panel accepted in accordance with Rule 61Â of theÂ University
   TribunalâsÂ Rules of Practice and Procedure.Â The TA provided evidence
   thatÂ she was responsible for grading Parts 1-3 of the Exam as well as
   questions A and BÂ of Part 4, whereas the Professor was responsible for
   grading question C of Part 4 and tallying up the total marks for Part
   4.Â The TA further provided evidence that she prepared a spreadsheet
   where she recorded the marks of all the students after she completed
   grading the midterm exams; once complete, the TA returnedÂ the exams
   and her spreadsheet to the Professor.Â The Professor provided the same
   evidence as the TA with respect to the marking responsibilities, the
   spreadsheet and the return of exams.Â The Professor provided further
   evidence thatÂ sheÂ created an independent spreadsheetÂ which contained
   a more detailed breakdown of the marks than the TAâs spreadsheet.
   TheÂ independently createdÂ spreadsheetsÂ contained the same marks for
   the StudentÂ which was directly transcribedÂ from the exam
   booklets.Â The Panel received evidence from the Professor that the
   Student reached out to her via email after the exams were returned and
   indicated that some parts of the exam mayÂ be incorrect.Â The Professor
   noted inÂ herÂ evidence thatÂ during the meeting with the
   StudentÂ sheÂ calculatedÂ the marks and determined thatÂ the
   calculation of marks for Part 2 was incorrectÂ and retainedÂ the exam
   to review it further in the event any other errors were made.Â The
   Professor further addedÂ thatÂ once the Student left, she undertook
   aÂ more careful review of theÂ examÂ and noted that there wereÂ a
   number ofÂ anomaliesÂ that were cause for concern. It appeared that
   some comments made by the TA and/or herself had been erased or whited
   outÂ and that some marks had been changed.Â It was the Professor and
   TAâs evidence that they both graded the exam with an erasable red pen.

   The Panel heard evidenceÂ from the Student that she met with the
   Professor four days after the initial meeting and at that time she
   denied changing the exam and resubmitting it for grading.Â The Student
   further attests thatÂ someone else must have made the changes to the
   exam and that any error in the marking was done by someone
   else.Â Furthermore, the Student denied that in her original meeting
   with the Professor that she asked for additional marks; it was her
   evidence that she only wanted clarification on some comments that she
   did not understand.Â It was the Studentâs evidence that any white out
   on the exam occurred during the exam and not after she received the
   exam back from the Professor.Â After reviewing the evidence and
   testimonies, the Panel accepted the evidence of the ProfessorÂ and TA
   and rejectedÂ the evidence of the Student. The Panel found that it was
   simply implausible that both the Professor and the TA would make the
   same mistakes in their marking of the Studentâs examinationÂ and
   thatÂ both of themÂ would make identical errors entering the marks into
   their respective spreadsheets.Â Further, upon review of the exam
   booklet and the Studentâs testimony, the Panel found thatÂ the Student
   was not credible and that it was more likely than not that the Student
   altered the exam.Â The Panel foundÂ that there was clear and convincing
   evidence, on a balance of probabilities,Â that the Student was guilty
   ofÂ one count ofÂ knowingly forging or in any other wayÂ altering or
   falsifying a document, namely the exam booklet, andÂ making use of such
   forged, altered or falsified document, contrary toÂ section B.i.1(a) of
   theÂ Code.Â Based on this finding, the University withdrew the
   alternative charge.

   In determining sanction,â¯the Panel considered the principles and
   factors relevant to sanction discussed inÂ University of Toronto and
   Mr. C. (âMr. C. factorsâ) andÂ found that the Student did not provide
   the Panel with any character evidenceÂ and so they were left with only
   the evidence that the Student has now been found guilty twice of having
   cheated on examinations.Â In considering the likelihood of a repetition
   of the offence,Â the Panel notedÂ this is the second offence by the
   Student andÂ itÂ was committed very shortly after her previous
   suspension completed.Â The Panel found that when considering the nature
   of the offence, it is important to note that cheating attacks the
   integrity of examinationsÂ and the UniversityÂ undertakes significant
   expense to protect the integrity of its examinations. Therefore, due to
   the lack of remorse from the Student, the potential for great detriment
   to the University, the seriousness of the offence andÂ the need to send
   a clear message thatÂ underhandedÂ attempts to undermine academic
   integrity of examinationsÂ will not be tolerated, the PanelÂ found that
   aÂ strong sanctionÂ was required.Â The Panel imposed the following
   sanctions: a final grade of zero in the course;
   aÂ four-yearÂ suspension; aÂ five-yearÂ notation of the sanction on the
   transcript; and aÂ report to the Provost for aÂ publication.

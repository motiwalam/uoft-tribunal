   Student charged with three offences under s. B.i.1(d), five offences
   under s. B.i.1(b) and in the alternative, four offences under s.
   B.i.3(b) of the Code. The charges related to alleged misconduct in four
   distinct courses.

   Two of the five charges under s. B.i.1(b) related to allegations that
   the Student used or possessed unauthorized aids during an examination
   in two different classes. During one exam, the Student had in his
   possession a bundle of notes and a smart phone. In the other, the
   Student had in his possession a copy of a previous yearâs exam and
   solutions. Another two of the five charges under s. B.i.1(b) related to
   allegations that the Student made unauthorized use of Blackboard
   discussion threads from a prior session of the course when formulating
   his own mandatory online discussion contributions. These contributions
   were explicitly intended to reflect the Studentâs own work. The final
   charge under s. B.i.1(b) relates to an allegation that the Student made
   unauthorized use of a copy of the professorâs answer guide from a prior
   year that was posted on the internet in order to complete an
   assignment. Two of the three charges under s. B.i.1(d) related to
   allegations that the Student included verbatim and nearly verbatim
   excerpts from a prior sessionâs Blackboard discussion threads in his
   own mandatory online discussion contributions without attribution. The
   third charge under s. B.i.1(d) related to allegations that the Student
   included verbatim and nearly verbatim excerpts from the professorâs
   answer key in his own assignment without attribution.

   The Student pleaded guilty and the matter proceeded by way of an Agreed
   Statement of Facts. The Panel accepted the Studentâs guilty pleas and
   the University withdrew the four alternative charges. The parties
   presented a Joint Submission on Penalty. The Student had been
   sanctioned for academic misconduct on one prior occasion. The prior
   offence involved the possession of an unauthorized aid during a final
   examination and the Student was sanctioned at the Decanal level. The
   Panel highlighted that the misconduct regarding the use of unauthorized
   aids was brazen and repeated. The Panel noted that in one instance, the
   Student used unauthorized aids despite being personally told by the
   invigilating professor to put them away. The Panel observed that the
   Student committed misconduct in five courses (the four being considered
   by the Panel, and the one instance of prior misconduct) and expressed
   concern that the Student is likely to continue the pattern of
   misconduct should he continue to be a student at the University. The
   Panel noted that the Student had been cooperative and had presented a
   letter that included a genuine expression of remorse and demonstrated a
   degree of insight. The Panel noted that the information provided as to
   the nature and timing of potential health difficulties the Student may
   have was insufficient to mitigate the seriousness of the misconduct at
   issue. The Panel accepted the joint submission and imposed a final
   grade of zero in four courses, a suspension just over 56-months, a
   notation on the Studentâs transcript for just over 56-months, and
   ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

   Grievances

   The hearing was conducted via Skype as the Student resides in Taiwan.
   The Student had the opportunity to seek legal advice but declined
   representation. The Student and the University entered into an Agreed
   Statement of Facts (ASF) in which the Student admitted to committing
   the offence of knowingly using or possessing an unauthorized aid
   (notes) under s. B.i.3(b) during a quiz. The Student was also charged
   with an offence under s. B.i.3(b) , in the alternative, which was
   withdrawn. The Panel accepted the guilty plea.

   The parties presented a Joint Submission on Penalty proposing a final
   grade of zero in the course, a suspension of three years, a notation on
   the Student‚s transcript until graduation and that the case be reported
   to the Provost for publication. The ASF contained relevant
   circumstances including that the Student had come to Canada from Taiwan
   seven years previously and that the Student had been sanctioned for
   academic misconduct on two prior occasions. The prior offences involved
   the possession of notes during an examination, for which the Student
   was received a grade of zero and a notation on her transcript for six
   months, and submitting an assignment prepared with unauthorized
   assistance, for which the Student received a zero on the assignment.
   The Student met with the Dean‚s Designate, pleading guilty to the
   offence at that time, and explained that she had suffered from anxiety
   and depression since she was a teenager, had been on medication and was
   isolated. The Student provided documents stating that she sought
   assistance from UTM Health and Counseling, had been hospitalized for
   suicidal ideation and depression and was diagnosed by a psychiatrist
   with Major Depressive Disorder. The Student left Canada earlier in the
   year, returning to Taiwan where she is looking for work, but intends to
   return to the University at the end of her suspension. The University
   would have sought a more serious penalty than a three year suspension
   but for the Student pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity and
   full cooperation during the process, the Student seeking and complying
   with medical treatment and the Student‚s expression of remorse. The
   University also submitted that ‚while the Student‚s depression and
   anxiety are relevant to the appropriate sanction, her medical condition
   nether excuses nor justifies her unacceptable conduct.‚

   The Panel noted that the Student‚s mental health challenges were
   relevant to penalty for this Student. The Student was aware of her
   academic dishonesty and her mental health history is not a mitigating
   factor on the basis that her ability to know ‚right from wrong‚ was not
   impaired. The Panel accepted the joint submission and imposed a final
   grade of zero in the course, a suspension of three years from the day
   of the order, a notation on the Student‚s transcript until graduation
   and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.
   The Panel noted that had the Student not cooperated, provided insight
   into her personal circumstances and expressed sincere remorse, the
   Panel would have imposed a more serious penalty given the prior
   offences.

   Student charged with two offences under s. B.i.1(b) of the Code. The
   charges related to allegations that the Student made verbal requests of
   one or more students, and looked at one or more studentsâ papers, to
   obtain, or attempt to obtain, assistance in completing a term test,
   and, that while attending a final examination in the same course, the
   Student had on his on desk an active cell phone and made efforts to
   speak with a fellow student to obtain, or attempt to obtain, assistance
   in writing the examination. The Student pleaded guilty to the charges
   under s. B.i.1(b) of the Code. The parties submitted an Agreed
   Statement of Facts. The Panel considered the Agreed Statement of Facts
   and questions and accepted the Studentâs plea. The Parties submitted a
   joint submission with respect to sanction. The Panel considered a
   review of the facts and of similar Tribunal decisions and found that
   the joint submission with respect to sanction fulfilled the goals set
   out in the case of Mr. C. and that it emphasized the importance of
   reformation, deterrence, and the protection of the University and its
   educational mission. The Panel accepted the joint submission with
   respect to sanction and imposed a grade of zero in the course; a
   one-year suspension; a two-year notation on the Studentâs academic
   record; and that a report be issued to the Provost.

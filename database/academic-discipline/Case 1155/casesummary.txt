   Theâ¯Studentâ¯was charged underâ¯s. B.i.1(a)â¯of theâ¯Code of Behaviour
   on Academic Matters, 1995â¯(theÂ âCodeâ)Â with two counts
   ofÂ knowinglyÂ alteringÂ or falsifying a document or evidence required
   by the University orÂ uttering,Â circulatingÂ or making use of the
   altered or falsifiedÂ document, namely a VOI, which
   theÂ StudentÂ submitted in support of his petition requests for a late
   withdrawal in five courses.Â In the alternative, theâ¯Studentâ¯was
   charged under s.â¯B.i.3(b) of theâ¯Codeâ¯on the basis that
   theâ¯Studentâ¯knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct,Â fraudÂ or misrepresentationâ¯in order
   toâ¯obtain academic credit or other academic advantage.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of
   theâ¯Studentâ¯appeared at the hearing.â¯The PanelÂ waited fifteen
   minutesÂ after the hearing was scheduled to commenceÂ to allow for
   theÂ StudentÂ toÂ appear, but theÂ StudentÂ did not appear.Â The
   Universityâsâ¯Policy on Official Correspondence with Studentsâ¯provides
   thatÂ students areÂ responsible for maintaining a current and valid
   postal address and email account inÂ ROSI. Students are expected to
   monitor and retrieve all mail, including emails, on a frequent and
   consistent basis.Â Rule 9(c)Â of theâ¯UniversityÂ TribunalâsÂ Rules of
   Practice and ProcedureÂ (âRulesâ)â¯provides thatâ¯service can
   beâ¯effectedâ¯viaâ¯email to the studentâs email address in ROSI.â¯The
   University provided evidence that theâ¯Studentâ¯had been served at his
   ROSI-listed email address with theâ¯chargesâ¯and notice
   ofÂ electronicÂ hearing.â¯Theâ¯Studentâ¯was subsequently provided an
   opportunity to provide submissions in relation to the request ofâ¯the
   Provost of the Universityâ¯for the hearing to
   proceedÂ electronically.Â Theâ¯Studentâ¯did not respond to this request
   and the hearing was ordered to proceed electronically.Â Counsel for the
   University provided further evidence thatÂ theÂ StudentâsÂ email
   account had been accessedÂ after the chargesÂ and the email
   correspondence from the Tribunal seekingÂ submission on the format of
   the hearing.â¯The charges,â¯notice,Â and the submissions requestÂ went
   unanswered.â¯â¯The Panel found thatÂ reasonable notice of the hearing
   had been provided to theÂ StudentÂ in accordance with the Rules,
   therefore the Panel ordered that the hearingÂ proceed in
   theâ¯Studentâsâ¯absenceÂ in accordance withÂ Rule 17 of the Rules.

   Regarding the charges laid under s.â¯B.i.1(a)â¯of theâ¯Code, theâ¯Panel
   examined theÂ affidavitÂ evidence ofâ¯theÂ Assistant Registrar of
   Academic StandardsÂ & Petitions in the Office of the Registrar at the
   University of Toronto Mississauga (âUTMâ). The Assistant Registrarâs
   evidenceÂ explained that their office facilitates student requestsÂ to
   withdraw from courses past the deadline.Â The Assistant
   RegistrarÂ affidavit furtherÂ advised that theÂ StudentÂ submitted a
   petition for late withdrawal without academic penalty for five courses
   in the 2019-2020 academic year.Â The VOI submitted by
   theÂ StudentÂ purportedÂ to be signed by a physician at Centenary
   HospitalÂ in ScarboroughÂ which supported his claims of depression and
   noted that theÂ StudentÂ required increased rest and a reduced
   workload.Â TheÂ StudentÂ attached the same VOI to his request for a
   refund of his Winter 2020 fees.Â It was theÂ Assistant
   RegistrarÂ evidenceÂ that the Registrarâs Office contacted Centenary
   Hospital to confirm if the doctor identified on the VOI has completed
   and signed the document.Â The doctor informed the Health Information
   Management office of Centenary Hospital that he had not filled out the
   VOIÂ and that none of the writing on the VOI, including the signature,
   belonged to him. Centenary Hospital relayedÂ this information to the
   Registrarâs Office.Â The Panel alsoÂ received affidavit evidence of the
   Manager of Academic Integrity & Affairs at the Academic Integrity Unit
   in the Office of the Dean at UTMÂ (âManagerâ).Â TheÂ Panel had an
   opportunity to ask questions of the ManagerÂ as she was present at the
   Deanâs meetings and took minutes.Â The minutes were not attached to
   theÂ ManagerâsÂ affidavit but were obtained by Counsel and provided to
   the PanelÂ during the hearing.Â These minutes were admitted into
   evidence pursuant toÂ rules 64 and 65 of the Rules.Â Once the Panel had
   an opportunity to review the minutes, they found that the contents of
   the Managerâs affidavit and the minutes were consistent.Â The Panel
   noted that, pursuant to the Managerâs evidence, at the commencement of
   the meeting, pursuant to s.Â C.i(a)6 of the Code,Â the Student was
   given the Deanâs WarningÂ which warns theÂ StudentÂ that
   anyÂ admissions or statements made during the meeting can be used or
   received in evidence against theÂ StudentÂ in the hearing.Â In
   accordance with this,Â the Panel accepted the admissions of
   theÂ StudentÂ as evidence in the hearing.Â The Panel noted that at the
   hearing theÂ StudentÂ explained that he had lostÂ both of his
   grandparents the previous year and that this had a significant impact
   on him. TheÂ StudentÂ further explained that he had not seen a doctor
   but knew he needed documentation from a physicianÂ so a friend of his
   offered to have someone fill out a VOI for him. TheÂ StudentÂ accepted
   the friendâs offerÂ and submitted a forged VOI in support of his
   petition for late withdrawal.Â Based on the evidence, including
   theÂ StudentâsÂ admission,Â the Panel found that theÂ StudentÂ was
   guilty ofÂ two counts of knowingly using a falsified document contrary
   to s.Â B.i.1(a) of the Code. Due to the Panelâs finding, the University
   withdrew the alternative charge.

   In determining sanction,â¯theâ¯Panel considered the principles and
   factors relevant to sanctionâ¯discussed inâ¯University of Toronto and
   Mr. C.â¯(âMr. C. factorsâ)â¯and determined thatâ¯it was important to
   consider the serious nature of the offence, the detriment to the
   UniversityÂ occasioned by the offenceÂ and the need to deter others
   from committing similar offences.â¯The PanelÂ agreedÂ with the decision
   inÂ University of Toronto v. X.T.Â (Case No. 1080, September 29,
   2020)Â with respectÂ toÂ the aforementioned factors. The PanelÂ in that
   case noted that forgery is a serious offence, especially
   givenÂ theÂ deliberate nature of the offence; that it undermines the
   integrity of those charged with providing the medical notes, as well as
   the Universityâs procedure for assessingÂ and
   grantingÂ accommodationsÂ to its students; andÂ that theÂ University
   andÂ Tribunal must send a strong message to other students that such
   misconduct is considered a serious offence.Â The Panel further noted
   thatÂ since theÂ StudentÂ did not participate at any stage of the
   hearing process there is no evidence before the Panel of good
   character,Â likelihood of repetition of the offence, or mitigating or
   extenuating circumstances.Â The PanelÂ did considerÂ the factÂ that
   theÂ StudentÂ admitted to the offence and was cooperativeÂ with the
   discipline process up to the Deanâs Meeting but this, in the view of
   the Panel, did not amount to an exceptional circumstance which would
   causeÂ itÂ to deviateÂ from the recommended sanctions provided in the
   Code, nor from the sanctions imposed in similar
   cases.Â Theâ¯Panelâ¯imposedâ¯the following sanctions:â¯a final grade of
   zero in theÂ fiveÂ courses;â¯aâ¯two-year suspension;â¯aâ¯three-year
   notation on the transcript; andâ¯aÂ report to
   theÂ ProvostÂ forÂ publication.

   The Student was charged under section B.i.1(c) of the Code of Behaviour
   on Academic Matters , 2019 (the ‚ Code ‚) , for knowingly having
   another person personate the Student at a final exam. In the
   alternative, the Student was charged under section B.i.3(b) of the
   Code, for knowingly engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty
   or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in
   the Code in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage
   of any kind in connection with a final exam.

   The Student attended the hearing. The Provost and the Student submitted
   an Agreed Statement of Facts (‚ASF‚). The Panel received evidence that
   the Student was required to write a final exam worth 45% of their final
   grade in the course from which the charges arise. In a Dean‚s Designate
   meeting, the Student admitted that they did not write the final exam
   but instead had someone else write the exam for them. The ASF detailed
   that the Student admitted that they were guilty of having another
   person personate them at the final exam, and that they were guilty of
   obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection with the final exam.
   Based on the ASF and the Student‚s admissions, the Panel found the
   Student guilty of knowingly having another person personate them. In
   accordance with the ASF, the University withdrew the alternative
   charges.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel reviewed a Joint
   Submission on Penalty (‚JSP‚) and Agreed Statement of Facts on Penalty
   (‚ASFP‚) submitted by the Student and the Provost. The Panel further
   considered the Student‚s undertaking that, after the completion of the
   suspension proposed in the JSP, they would not register for any courses
   at the University of Toronto or apply for admission to any programs at
   the University of Toronto (the ‚Undertaking‚). The Panel noted that the
   Undertaking did not form any part of the Tribunal‚s decision, and
   further noted that the Code does not provide the Tribunal a penalty
   like the Undertaking.

   The Panel reviewed the ASFP which detailed the Student‚s prior academic
   offence, and the Student‚s personal circumstances at the time of the
   offence. The Panel considered prior Tribunal decisions, and ultimately
   concluded that the sanction proposed in the JSP was within the range of
   appropriate penalties given the nature of the offence and the Student‚s
   past conviction. The Panel noted that personation is a very serious
   offence that strikes at the heart of academic integrity by undermining
   the evaluation process and fairness to other students. However, the
   Panel considered the Student‚s early admission of guilt and cooperation
   in the discipline process to be mitigating factors.

   In accordance with the JSP, the Panel imposed the following sanction on
   the Student: a final grade of zero in the Course; a five-year
   suspension from the University; a 10-year notation on the Student‚s
   academic record and transcript; and a report to the Provost for
   publication.

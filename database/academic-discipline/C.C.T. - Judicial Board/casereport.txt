Charges and Procedural History

1.

The Judicial Board (the “Board”) held a hearing on March 27, 2024, to address the
following charges brought by the University of Toronto (the “University”) against
C

-C

T

(the “Former Student”) pursuant to s. 48(c) of the University of

Toronto Act, 1947 (the “1947 Act”) and s. 2(14)(o) of the University of Toronto Act,
1971 (the “1971 Act”), collectively, the “Acts”:
1. On or about April 18, 2022, you were guilty of infamous conduct in that you forged
or in any other way altered or falsified an academic record, and/or uttered,
circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or falsified record, and/or
attempted to utter, circulate or make use of such forged, altered or falsified record,
namely a document purporting to be a transcript of your academic history at the
University of Toronto.
2. On or about April 18, 2022, you were guilty of disgraceful conduct in that you forged
or in any other way altered or falsified an academic record, and/or uttered,
circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or falsified record, and/or
attempted to utter, circulate or make use of such forged, altered or falsified record,
namely a document purporting to be a transcript of your academic history at the
University of Toronto.
3. On or about April 18, 2022, you were guilty of conduct unbecoming a graduate of
the University in that you forged or in any other way altered or falsified an academic
record, and/or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or
falsified record, and/or attempted to utter, circulate or make use of such forged,
altered or falsified record, namely a document purporting to be a transcript of your
academic history at the University of Toronto.

2. The Former Student was first registered in the Faculty of Arts and Science,
University of Toronto in Fall 2016. In June 2021, he graduated from the University
of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science degree. The facts forming the
basis of the charges occurred after the Former Student had graduated from the
University. It is for that reason that the charges are being adjudicated by a Judicial
Board of the Governing Council and not the University Tribunal.

2

II.

Agreed Statement of Facts.

2.

At the outset of the hearing, the Board was advised that the Former Student was
pleading guilty to charge 3 and that the matter would proceed on the basis of an
Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”, attached as Appendix A to this decision without
appended documents). The Board was also advised that if the Former Student’s
plea was accepted, that the University would withdraw the first and second charges.
The Board received into evidence a Book of Documents that included the ASF.

3.

The Former Student pleaded guilty to charge 3, on the basis that an agent acting on
his behalf falsified his academic record and made use of that falsified academic
record in applying to graduate schools, and that while he was not personally aware
that the agent had falsified these records, he acknowledges that it was his
responsibility to supervise agents who were submitting applications on his behalf,
and that his failure to do so constitutes conduct unbecoming a graduate of the
University of Toronto.

4.

The following description of the facts is taken from the ASF.
7. On April 18, 2022, Sana Kawar, the former Manager of the University of Toronto
Transcript Centre, received an email from World Education Services (“WES”). This
email attached a copy of a document purporting to be the University transcript of
the Former Student (the “Purported Transcript”) and requested that the University
verify its authenticity.
8. The Purported Transcript indicated it was a Transcript of Consolidated Academic
Record as of January 26, 2021. It contained the Former Student’s name, student
number, and birth month and day. It further indicated that the Former Student had
been enrolled in courses from 2016 Fall to 2021 Winter, that he had earned a total
of 23.5 credits to date with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 3.83, and
that he continued to be enrolled in six courses in the 2021 Winter term for which
he would earn a further 3.0 credits if successful in each.
9. WES is an organization that provides credential evaluations for international
students and immigrants planning to work or study in the United States and
Canada.
3

10. The Purported Transcript does not accurately reflect the grade information
contained in the Official Academic Record. In comparing the Purported Transcript
with the Official Academic Record, all of the numerical grades from Fall 2016
through the Winter 2020 term were inflated, including sessional, annual, and
cumulative grade point averages. Two of the seven grades earned in Summer
2020 and Fall 202 [sic] were also inflated, as were some of the GPA numbers.
[…]
15. The Purported Transcript was dated January 26, 2021, when the Former Student
was an active student. Accordingly, the allegation was initially dealt with as an
offence under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters.
16. On June 1, 2022, the office of Student Academic Integrity (“SAI”) emailed the
Former Student inviting him to meet with the Dean’s Designate to discuss the
allegations. On June 15, 2021, the Former Student met with Colleen Dockstader,
Dean’s Designate for Academic Integrity, to discuss the allegations against him
(the “DD Meeting”). Laurie O’Handley, an Academic Integrity Specialist, also
attended the DD Meeting and took notes.
[…]
19. During the meeting, the Former Student denied he had committed the academic
offence of forgery. At the meeting and afterwards, the Former Student provided
the following information:
(a) he and his mother engaged an agency called “GATEIVY” (the “Agency”)
to help him apply to graduate school (later the Former Student clarified
that the counterparty to the contract with the Agency was a company
called “Shanghai Erlun Education Technology Co., Ltd.”, not “GATEIVY”);
(b) his mother paid the Agency approximately $600-800 CAD to help edit
and submit the Former Student’s graduate school applications (later the
Former Student clarified that the amount paid was $5,000 USD);
(c) he provided the Agency with a personal statement, an official transcript,
and recommendation letter. He sent the Agency a transcript downloaded
from the Accessible Campus Online Resource Network (“ACORN”), a
4

web-based tool that stores students’ academic, personal, and financial
records;
(d) the fee was paid upfront, and the Agency was not paid more if the Former
Student was accepted to graduate school;
(e) the Purported Transcript was doctored by the Agency and submitted to
WES without his knowledge;
(f) the Agency claimed to be based in Boston, United States and that they
have an office in Shanghai, China (later the Former Student clarified that
the Agency is based in Shanghai, China). The Former Student stated that
he communicated with the Agency remotely and never met the
representatives in person;
(g) after he received an email from SAI notifying him of the allegations, he
tried to contact the Agency using WeChat. He stated that he tried to reach
the Agency’s manager but could not make contact because the Agency
was “bankrupted” in May 2021, and its website disappeared.
[…]
26. On June 16, 2022, SAI sent an email to the Former Student advising him that the
matter would be forwarded to the Vice-Provost for review with the recommendation
that charges be laid. The matter was subsequently forwarded to the Office of the
Vice-Provost, Faculty and Academic Life.

III.

Finding on Charges

5.

The University must establish on a balance of probabilities that an academic offence
under the 1947 Act has been committed by the Former Student. The 1947 Act
creates obligations on former students not to engage in infamous conduct,
disgraceful conduct, or conduct unbecoming a graduate of the University.

6.

In this case, the Board concluded that charge 3 had been proven and accepted the
guilty plea of the Former Student in respect of that charge.

5

7.

Although the Former Student's plea does not admit actual knowledge of the
Agency's falsifications, the Former Student failed to supervise the Agency or review
any applications submitted on his behalf. A student or former student cannot
contract out of his responsibility to ensure that University records submitted in
applications are authentic.

8.

Here, the Former Student knew that the Agency would be submitting applications
on his behalf; knew that the contract with the Agency included a reference to
“personal background upscaling;” and knew from the contract that the Agency had
an incentive to get the Former Student into a graduate program so as not to have to
work for free for a further semester if the original applications failed.

9.

The Former Student was reckless in his failure to supervise the Agency and
abdicated his responsibility. Such abdication of responsibility constitutes conduct
unbecoming a graduate of the University.

10. As was expressed in the University of Toronto and T. C. H. (October 29, 2019):
The integrity of the University as an educational institution and as a degree
granting body is fundamental to the academic relationship, including the
relationship between the Former Student and this University. Many
important third parties, including as in this case institutions of higher
education, rely on the records of transcripts, degrees and apparent letters
of reference as correctly representing the academic achievements of those
who submit them. Falsification of transcripts and letters of reference strikes
at the heart of the honesty and integrity which is at the core of the academic
experience and evaluation. It not only undermines the credibility of the
University, but also the credibility of other students who have achieved and
seek to rely on the records contained in their transcripts. The Former
Student failed to ensure that the records he submitted to other academic
institutions were accurate.

11. Based on both the Former Student's admission and the uncontradicted evidence as
to the use of the falsified transcript by the Former Student’s agent, the Board is
satisfied that the Former Student uttered, circulated or made use of a forged, altered
or falsified record, being a University of Toronto transcript.
12. Given the finding of guilt on charge 3, the University withdrew the first and second
charges.
6

IV.

Finding on Penalty

13. The sanctions that may be imposed for conduct found to be infamous, disgraceful,
or unbecoming a graduate of the University are the cancellation, recall or
suspension of a student’s degree.
14. Once the Board had made a determination on the charges, the Board was provided
with a Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”), which is attached as Appendix B. The
proposed penalty included the following:
1. The Bachelor of Science degree conferred by the University of Toronto on
the Former Student be suspended for five years from the date of this order;
2. The Former Student be required and directed to surrender for the degree
certificate evidencing the Bachelor of Science degree conferred on him by
the University of Toronto for the period of the suspension; and
3. The fact that the University of Toronto has suspended for five years the
Bachelor of Science degree it conferred on the Former Student be recorded
on his academic record and transcript for a period of seven years from the
date of this order.
15. To support this proposed penalty, Counsel to the University made submissions on
the following:
1. The high bar to depart from a JSP;
2. Relevant factors in determining appropriate sanctions; and
3. The typical penalties for similar cases.
A.

High Bar to Depart from JSP

16. The Board is not bound by the JSP and can decide on a penalty that is greater or
lesser than what is being proposed. However, a joint submission with respect to
penalty should be accepted unless the submission would be contrary to the public
interest or bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
7

17. As was expressed in University of Toronto and W.K. (Case no. 1197, May 3, 2022)
(“W.K.”):
The Tribunal is aware of the value in respecting and deferring to joint
submissions. While the Tribunal retains the discretion to reject joint
submissions in appropriate cases, the fact that adversarial parties have
agreed on the appropriate sanction is a strong indication that the
appropriate balancing of interests has occurred.

18. The Former Student has acknowledged that the Board has the ability to depart from
a joint sentencing submission if it has grounds to do so, including to impose a more
severe penalty than the one the JSP recommends.
B.

Relevant Factors

19. It is well established in cases under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters,
that in determining an appropriate sanction the following factors should be
considered:
1. the character of the person charged;
2. the likelihood of repetition of the offence;
3. the nature of the offence committed;
4. any extenuating circumstances surrounding commission of the offence;
5. the detriment to the University occasioned by the offence; and
6. the need to deter others from committing a similar offence.
20. These factors apply equally for cases before the Judicial Board.
21. Character of the Former Student: The Former Student has admitted the offence
which shows that he has insight into his actions and remorse for his conduct. In
addition, the Former Student has participated and cooperated in the proceeding by
entering into an ASF and JSP. Counsel to the Former Student was also permitted
to read a letter from the Former Student into the record. In that letter, the Former
Student expressed remorse and apologized for his actions. He also detailed what
8

may be considered mitigating personal circumstances, but counsel was quick to
agree that these circumstances were not being introduced by way of evidence and
could not be taken into consideration by the Board in that way. The letter did,
however, further support the submission that the Former Student has taken
ownership and responsibility for his actions.
22. Likelihood of Repetition of the Offence: The likelihood of repetition of the offence
by the Former Student is low, both because he is no longer a student and because
he had no prior academic offences while attending the University. There is therefore
no pattern of conduct that requires specific deterrence.
23. Nature of the Offence, General Deterrence, and Detriment Occasioned to
University: A forged transcript is a very serious offence. Where there are forged
transcripts in circulation being submitted to other academic institutions and
employers, the detriment occasioned to the University is very high. The University
and its students expect and need others to be able to rely on the authenticity of
transcripts and other University records. Forged records undermine the credibility
and standing of the University and of the Former Student’s peers. The need for
general deterrence is also very high because of the impact of such offences on the
University. The seriousness of the offence is not lessened when an Agency is the
one who has forged the transcript on the Former Student’s behalf.
24. Extenuating Circumstances: There is no evidence of extenuating circumstances.
As noted above, the letter from the Former Student, while speaking to certain
personal circumstances, was not evidence of those facts.
25. Taken as a whole, the factors suggest that the proposed penalty is reasonable, and
balances the important need for general deterrence and the Former Student’s
remorse and cooperation with the proceeding.

9

C.

Similar Cases

26. The five-year suspension of degree is also in line with similar cases presented by
Counsel to the University. While the Board is not bound by any of these decisions,
they are helpful in assisting the Judicial Board in treating like cases alike.
27. In particular, the Board was directed to three Judicial Board decisions in which a
five-year suspension of degree was ordered against a Former Student was in similar
contexts: the University of Toronto and C.Y. (August 14, 2023) (“C.Y.”); the
University of Toronto and Y.L. (September 10, 2021); and the University of Toronto
and T.C.H. (October 29, 2019).
28. All of these cases involved former students using agencies to assist in preparing
applications, and in which the former students were found to have participated
recklessly in the circulation of forged University records.
29. On that basis, the Board found that the five-years suspension of degree was
reasonable.
30. With respect to the notation on the transcript, the parties propose a seven-year
notation, which is two years longer than the proposed suspension. The three cases
listed above include either a five-year notation or a permanent notation. In support
of a seven-year notation, Counsel to the University characterised the seven-years
as “somewhere in the middle.” In contrasting C.Y. where the notation had been for
only five years, Counsel noted that the former student in C.Y. had also lost their
Master’s degree due of the forged transcript, and so the impact on the student was
already very high.
31. The Board is of the view that the seven-year notation proposed is reasonable in all
the circumstances, and will not deviate from the JSP given the high threshold to do
so.
32. However, the Board notes that, unlike in Tribunal cases, a length of notation greater
than the length of suspension should not be the default in Judicial Board cases. One
of the central purposes of the notation is, as was said in the W. K., “to ensure that
10

future professors and invigilators are aware of the Student’s disciplinary history and
are able to provide appropriate scrutiny of the Student’s work” (para. 18). That
purpose does not exist in the context of former students. A notation that is longer
than the suspension can have the effect – for all practical purposes – of lengthening
the suspension itself. While a longer or permanent notation may be warranted based
on the specific facts of a case, we are of the view that it should not be assumed to
be the default in Judicial Board cases.
33. Finally, we note that while s. 48(c) of 1947 Act does not explicitly speak to notations
on transcripts, the Judicial Board is vested with broad powers in respect of
“provid[ing] for the cancellation, recall or suspension” of a degree, and the
“procedure generally in respect of any such matter.” As such, we believe it is within
the jurisdiction of the Judicial Board to make such an order.

V.

Decision of the Board

34. The penalty proposed by both parties is reasonable in light of the relevant factors,
and is in line with penalties ordered in similar circumstances. The Board was
therefore of the view that accepting the joint submission on penalty would not bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.
35. At the conclusion of the hearing on penalty, the Board conferred and made the
following order:
1. The Former Student is guilty of conduct unbecoming a graduate of the
University in respect of an application for admission to graduate school;
2. The Bachelor of Science degree conferred by the University of Toronto on
the Former Student be suspended for five years from the date of this order;
3. The Former Student be required and directed to surrender for the degree
certificate evidencing the Bachelor of Science degree conferred on him by
the University of Toronto for the period of the suspension; and

11

4. The fact that the University of Toronto has suspended for five years the
Bachelor of Science degree it conferred on the Former Student be recorded
on his academic record and transcript for a period of seven years from the
date of this order.
5. The parties agree that this case may be reported to the Provost for
publication of a notice of the Judicial Board’s decision and the sanction
imposed, with the Former Student’s name withheld.

Admissions and acknowledgments

29.

Mr. T

admits that he did not prepare, review, or submit his application. He

further admits that:
(a)

the Purported Transcript was forged, altered and falsified in that it
inaccurately enhanced his academic record by inflating many of the marks
and grade point averages he received at the University of Toronto;

(b)

it is his responsibility to ensure that all information about his academic
record and history at the University of Toronto that is included in
applications for admission to programs at academic institutions is accurate;
and

(c)

his failure to do so constitutes conduct unbecoming a graduate of the
University of Toronto.

30.

Mr. T

acknowledges that he is signing this ASF freely and voluntarily, knowing

of the potential consequences he faces, and does so having had the opportunity to seek
the advice of counsel.
31.

Mr. T

acknowledges that the Provost has made no assurances to he about

what penalty the Judicial Board may impose if he is found to have violated the University
of Toronto Act, 1947, and that the Judicial Board is not bound to impose the penalty
sought by the Provost.
32.

The parties agree that this agreement may be signed electronically and in

counterparts.

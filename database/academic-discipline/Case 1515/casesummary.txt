   The Student was charged with three counts of knowingly forging,
   altering, or falsifying a document or evidence required by the
   University of Toronto, or uttering, circulating or making use of such
   forged, altered or falsified document, namely Verification of Student
   Illness (‚VOI‚) forms, submitted in support of the Student‚s request
   for academic accommodation or relief in three different courses
   (collectively, the ‚Courses‚), contrary to section B.I.1(a) of the Code
   of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019 (the ‚ Code ‚). In the
   alternative, the Student was charged with knowingly engaging in a form
   of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
   advantage of any kind. Contrary to section B.I.3(b) of the Code .

   The hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts. The
   Student was enrolled in three classes over the course of Summer 2022
   and Winter 2023. The Student was required to write final exams in each
   of the Courses. The Student submitted three VOI forms as part of
   requests to defer the final exams in each of the Courses. The VOI forms
   were forged, altered, or falsified and were not completed and signed by
   the doctor named on the forms. The Registrar‚s office, in Summer 2022,
   granted the exam deferral related to the first VOI form, but denied the
   petition related to the second and third VOI forms. Following the
   introduction of the ASF into evidence, the Panel accepted the Student‚s
   guilty plea to the three charges, under section B.I.1(a). The
   University withdrew the alternative charge.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered an Agreed
   Statement of Facts on Penalty (the ‚ASFP‚), and a Joint Submission on
   Penalty (the ‚JSP‚) submitted jointly by the Student and the
   University. The ASFP contained, among other information, a statement
   from the Student expressing remorse for their conduct and detailing
   their poor mental wellbeing at the time the offence was committed. The
   ASFP further detailed that the Student was taking antidepressants for
   depression and had received a medical note from a doctor detailing the
   Student‚s history of depression and anxiety. The Panel further
   considered the factors outlined in University of Toronto and Mr. C
   (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5, 1976) and similar cases decided by the
   Tribunal. With respect to the character of the student, the Panel noted
   that the Student had been forthright, apologetic, had participated at
   every step in the discipline process, and had faced mitigating
   circumstances at the time of the offence as detailed in the ASFP. These
   factors were, in the Panel‚s view, compelling and reflected well on the
   Student. With respect to the likelihood of repetition, the Panel noted
   that while there was a pattern of behaviour that suggested that the
   Student may repeat the offence, the Student had acknowledged and
   expressed insight into their actions. Finally, the Panel noted that the
   offence of forgery was a serious offence that undermined the
   University‚s procedure for assessing and granting accommodations to its
   students and required the Tribunal to send a strong message to deter
   other students from committing the offence. Based on its review of the
   Mr. C factors and similar cases decided by the Tribunal, the Panel
   concluded that the penalty contemplated by the JSP fell within the
   middle of the range of similar cases and would not bring the
   administration of justice into disrepute.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a final grade of zero in the
   Courses; a four-year suspension; and a five-year notation on the
   Student‚s academic record and transcript.

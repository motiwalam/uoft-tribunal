Charges and Hearing
1.

This panel of the University Tribunal held a hearing on February 10, 2021 to
consider the charges brought by the University of Toronto against the Student
under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (“Code”).

2.

The Student was charged with the Offences set out in Appendix A, attached.
Essentially, they relate to the alleged falsification of a degree certificate
purportedly issued by the University concerning the Student, and the subsequent
use of that forged certificate by the Student in an attempt to obtain employment.

Procedural Issues
3.

The Student did not appear at the hearing. The hearing took place based upon
an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) signed by the Student and by Assistant
Discipline Counsel.

4.

In the ASF, the Student acknowledged that he had received a copy of the
charges, had waived the reading of the charges, and pled guilty to Charge #1
(ASF, para. 3).

5.

The ASF also confirmed that the Student did not wish to attend or participate in
these proceedings. The Student requested that the University Tribunal proceed
in their absence and waived their right to any further notice of these proceedings.
The Student acknowledged their understanding that, in their absence, the
University Tribunal might find that the Student had committed an act or acts of
academic misconduct, and might impose sanctions against the Student as set
out in the Code. (ASF, para. 4).

Evidence and Findings
6.

The ASF set out the following facts:
(a)

The Student first registered as a student at the University of Toronto
Mississauga in Fall 2013. Since that time, he has earned 4.5 credits. In
Winter 2016, he was suspended from the University for one year because
of poor academic performance. He did not return to his studies after the
completion of that suspension. At all material times, he remained a
student member of the University.

(b)

The Student admitted that, as part of an application for employment, he
represented that he had graduated from the University of Toronto.

(c)

On February 19, 2020, a Verifications Researcher for Hire Right, a third
party verification service, attempted to confirm that the University awarded
the Student a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in 2017. The University

-3-

advised that, according to its records, no such degree had been granted to
him.

7.

(d)

On February 24, 2020, the Verifications Researcher again emailed the
University and stated “we just received a copy of the student’s degree.
Could you please let us know why no degree could be found? Please see
attached.”

(e)

The Student admitted that this degree certificate was forged and that he
circulated the forged degree certificate.

(f)

The Student purchased the forged transcript on-line from a person he met
over the Internet. He communicated with the forger over the messaging
app, WeChat. The Student knew when he was communicating with the
forger that they were selling forged degree certificates.

(g)

The Student paid $40,000 for the forged degree certificate. He did so in an
attempt to obtain employment to provide a stable income for his family,
including his wife and child.

(h)

The Student represented that he had graduated from the University of
Toronto knowing that statement to be false. He knowingly circulated a
forged degree certificate in an attempt to confirm his graduation from
University of Toronto.

Based upon these agreed facts, the Tribunal entered a finding of guilty on Count
1 of the Charges as set out in Appendix A.

Penalty
8.

The Provost submitted that the offences as proven demonstrate the most serious
lack of academic and personal integrity. They threaten the reputation of the
University and the students who pursue their degrees honestly and diligently.
The University sought a penalty that would include a recommendation from the
Tribunal that the Student be expelled from the University.

9.

The Tribunal is in full agreement with the Provost in terms of the gravity of the
offences and the need to impose the most severe penalty available to it. This
conclusion is consistent with the other similar cases that the Provost brought to
the Panel’s attention. Accordingly, we hereby;
(a)

order that the Student shall be suspended from the University for five
years; and

(b)

recommend to the President that he recommend to Governing Council
that the Student be expelled from the University of Toronto;

-4-

10.

We further order that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of
a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the name
of the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto this 22nd day of April, 2021.

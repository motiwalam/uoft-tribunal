-2-

The Appeal
1.

The appellant (the "Student") appeals from the decision of the University Tribunal on

January 15, 2018. In that decision, the Tribunal confirmed its reasons for finding the Student
guilty of two academic offences, namely, that he knowingly:

(a)

submitted a research report that contained concocted references to two academic

articles that did not exist, contrary to section B.i.l(f) of the Code of Behaviour on

Academic Matters (the "Code"); and

(b)

submitted to the Provost an altered and falsified version of a disciplinary letter

from his Vice-Dean, contrary to section B.i.l(a) of the Code.

In the same decision the panel imposed a final grade of zero in the course at issue and
suspended the Student for 5 years. It further recommended that the Student be expelled
from the University.

2.

The Student submits that the Tribunal applied the wrong standard of proof, specifically

that it found the Student guilty on a balance of probabilities. The Student submits that in so
doing the Tribunal erred by applying a lower standard of proof than that required under the Code

of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (the "Code"), namely that it be proved on a balance
that is clear and convincing.

3.

On this basis, the Student asks that the appeal be allowed, and the matter remitted to a

new panel of the Tribunal for a new hearing.

4.

For the reasons which follow, we dismiss the appeal.

-3The Decision Below

5.

Procedural Background The charges against the Student date back to April 2016. At

the time, the Student was suspended for an unrelated academic offence. The first hearing in this
matter took place on July 12, 2016. The Student did not attend, and the Tribunal found him
guilty of the charges, and imposed a penalty which included a recommendation to the President
that he recommend to Governing Council that the Student be expelled.

6.

As set out more fully in the June 26, 2017 Reasons for Decision of the Discipline Appeal

Board in this matter, the Student appealed the decision on the basis that he had not received
notice of the hearing. As he was under suspension, he said he did not check his University of
Toronto email during the period of his suspension. The Discipline Appeals Board concluded that
he did not have appropriate notice of the proceedings and remitted the matter to a new hearing
before the Tribunal.
7.

A second hearing before the Tribunal was held over two days. The Student was again

convicted of the charges, and the Tribunal imposed a sanction that included a recommendation to
the President that he recommend to Governing Council that the Student be expelled.
8.

The Student appealed this decision as well. On the originally scheduled date for the

hearing of this appeal it was determined that it was appropriate to adjourn the proceedings in
order to permit the Student to obtain legal assistance in the handling of the appeal and the
proceedings were accordingly adjourned.
9.

At the time of the adjournment this Appeal Panel drew the parties' attention to the

decision of the Co mi of Appeal for Ontario in Jacobs v. Ottawa Police Service, 2016 ONCA

-4-

345, and asked them to address on the resumption of the hearing whether that case affected the
determination of the standard of proof under the Code.
10.

The hearing resumed on February 1, 2019, with the Student represented as noted above.

11.

The First Charge In the winter of2015, the Student enrolled in CCT208-Writing &

Research Methods in Communication, an introductory course about quantitative and qualitative
research methods taught by Professor Maharajh (the "Course"). The outline for the course
contained a warning about academic integrity and provided a link to the Code.

12.

Students in the course were required to submit a research proposal, worth 25% of the

final mark, containing a proposed original research project and a brief review of the literature
and scholarship they had reviewed in preparation for the project. This required the use of 5 to 7
relevant peer-reviewed academic sources.
13.

The Student submitted a research proposal describing in specific te1ms 2 studies that the

Student purported to have reviewed in the context of his research. The sources were also listed
in the bibliography for his research proposal.
14.

The Teaching Assistant who marked the research proposal provided detailed feedback on

it. Although he noted that the Citation and Referencing was "Comprehensive, correct and
consistent" he went on to make the following observations as they related to the sources
proposed for the research proposal:

•

"As it is now, your bibliography is both incomplete and formatted incorrectly."

•

"Be sure to always include page reference - not publication date - where using direct
citation."

•

With reference to the citation "CCIT, 2014" a question mark.

-5-

•

With reference to a quotation that is attributed to a person without citation, a specification
that a citation is required.

•

With reference to a description of the results of "each stuqy": "Support this with
reference to the sources. This is too vague."

•

With reference to the entire bibliography: "This whole section is fom1atted incorrectly
and/or missing information."

•

With respect to a citation to"~,..._ Young Male Drivers and Media" (2014).
CCIT, University of Toronto - Mississauga, March, 2015: "What kind of sollrce is
this?"

•

"I'm not sure if these sources are appropriate since you did not provide full citations
(apparently)."

15.

The next requirement in the course was to submit a final research report referencing the

academic sources they relied on in their research proposals and connecting their own findings to
the literature they had previously reviewed.

In April, 2015, the Student submitted his tesearch report, "PoorD1iving Habits and

16.

Young Males: A Strong Influence?" examining the relationship between watching action films
depicting speeding and viewers' driving habits.
The Teaching Assistant who graded the Student's research report had concerns about 2 of

17.

the academic articles cited in it, which he drew to the attention of Professor Maharajh:
''Lake, David. "The Mindset of Media." University of Queens, 2008. Web. -Feb. 2015"
and
"Thompson, Joe. "Driving Habits of Young Males." (2011) Harvard University. Web.
March 20 15"

-6-

18.

Professor Maharajh testified that she reviewed the Student's research report and then

attempted to verify the existence of the two articles in question. She tried to locate them through
Google and university research databases, but was not able to locate any trace of either article.
She then attempted to contact the Student in order to discuss her concerns. The Student either
cancelled or failed to attend 3 meetings set for that purpose.
19.

The Student admits in his factum on this appeal that he did not address these allegations

in his testimony. He offered no explanation for failing to produce copies of the purported
articles at the hearing, or at any time subsequently.
20.

The Tribunal accepted Professor Maharajh's evidence and convicted the Student on the

first charge. The Panel held:
The evidence leads the Panel to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the
Student knowingly submitted academic work that contained concocted references
to one or more sources. In particular, the Panel inferred from Professor
Maharajh' s uncontradicted testimony that she was unable to locate any trace of the
Purported Sources, together with the absence of any evidence tendered by the
Student that the Purported Sources had in fact existed, that they were indeed
concocted.
21.

The Second Charge The second charge arises from circumstances surrounding a prior

offence of plagiarism. Specifically, in April of2015, the Student attended a meeting with the
Dean's Designate for Academic Integrity at UTM, and in the course of that meeting admitted
plagiarism, which he confirmed with a written admission of guilt.
22.

Later that month, the Vice-Dean, Undergraduate at UTM sent the Student a letter

imposing a sanction for the admitted plagiarism under the Code. The Disciplinary Letter
contained the following description of the sanction:

-7Therefore, under section C.I.(a)8 of the University's Code ofBehaviour on Academic
Matters, I impose the following sanctions:

23.

•

a mark of zero (0) for the assignment in question;

•

a further reduction of 25 marks from the final grade in the course; and

•

an annotation on transcript of "Mark reduced in CCT200H5F, 2014(9) due to
academic misconduct", for 12 months, from April 6, 2015 to April 6, 2016

Almost half a year later, on October 1, 2015, the Student wrote to the Vice-Provost,

Faculty and Academic Life, requesting a reconsideration of the sanction. He enclosed what he
said was a copy of the Disciplinary Letter. However, the version of the letter he enclosed
differed from that which had been sent in material ways. It read, in relevant part:

Therefore, under section C.I.( a)8 of the University's Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters, I impose the following sanctions:

24.

•

a mark of zero (0) for the assignment in question;

•

a reduction of 25 marks from the final grade in the course; and

•

an annotation on transcript of"Mark reduced in CCT200H5F, 2014(9)

In the course of the review of the Student's reconsideration request, the differences

between the Disciplinary Letter sent to the Student and the letter he enclosed with his request
came to light. Specifically, the letter enclosed by the Student did not include the word "further"
in the second bullet, and the second line of the third bullet, indicating that the transcript notation
was to be in place for 12 months, was omitted.

25.

In a letter to the Student, the Vice-Provost noted the difference between the original

Disciplinary Letter, and the letter included in the Student's reconsideration request and said "we
would appreciate your including a note on this in your response". The Student did not respond to
this request and was in due course advised that the sanction would not be changed.

- 826.

In his examination-in-chief before the Tribunal, the Student denied changing the

Disciplinary Letter before submitting it as part of his reconsideration request. However, he
offered no explanation for the difference between the two letters. Indeed, in explaining what he
said was an inaccuracy in the Disciplinary Letter, he responded as follows:

Q. Okay. So when you finally received the sanction letter, right, you were
dissatisfied with it. You thought it was inaccurate. Why?
A. The sanction letter and the wording of the actual sanction letter was ... I
wouldn't say it's unclear, but it's a bit hard to understand. The part where it
says, "A further reduction of 25 marks, 25 marks from where? There's
certain things in the sanction ... they were there, but it was just unclear to
understand. It was not explained thoroughly in the meeting .... (Emphasis
added.)

27.

As the Provost notes, this is effectively an admission that the Student received the

Disciplinary Letter in its original form.

28.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal found the Student's denials to be not credible,

particularly in light of the admission that he had received an unaltered letter, and concluded that
he had falsified the letter he had submitted with his reconsideration request. It noted:

The Student's assertion that he had not altered the April 9 Letter when he
submitted the Purported April 9 Letter to the Provost, in the face of Ms. Gaspini' s
evidence and the Student's own acceptance that the letter he submitted to the
Provost (that is the Purported April 9 Letter) differed from the sanctioning letter
that he had received from Ms. Gaspini, is simply not credible. The evidence
supports a finding on the balance of probabilities that the Student either altered the
April 9 Letter himself and submitted the Purported April 9 Letter to the Provost, or
knowingly circulated or made use of such altered letter when he made his
submission to the Provost.
29.

Sanction No further evidence was led by the Provost or the Student on the issue of

sanctions.

-9-

30.

The Provost sought a penalty consisting of a final grade of zero in the Course, suspension

from the University for up to 5 years, and a recommendation to the President of the University
that he recommend to the Governing Council that the Student be expelled. The Provost
submitted that all of these penalties were consistent with those imposed in similar matters.

31.

The Student's representative made submissions concerning the Student's good character,

general volunteerism, willingness to help others and involvement with the University girls'
volleyball team. The Tribunal noted that these submissions were not supported by any evidence
and observed that they were "not entirely disregarded by the Panel" although it was "very
difficult for the Panel to weigh them against the significant factors militating in favour of this
sanction requested by the University".
32.

The Tribunal accepted the Provost's submissions that the offences were serious, that they

were second and third offences and that they involved calculated dishonesty on the part of the
Student. It noted that the concoction of the purported sources was an offence committed within
days of the meeting in respect of a separate, admitted academic offence, and that the doctored
letter submitted by the Student was in the course of the University's discipline process itself.
33.

While noting that many of the cases relied upon by the Provost had the distinguishing

foature that the falsified/fabricated documents in issue were submitted to a third party, the
Tribunal concluded that the offences in which similar penalties had been imposed were indeed
similar. It concluded that the sanction requested by the Provost was appropriate.

The Issue on Appeal

34.

The Student's appeal is limited to one ground. He asserts that the Tribunal applied the

wrong standard of proof. As noted above, the Tribunal found the Student guilty on a balance of

- 10 -

probabilities. The Student says that is inc01Tect and that the Code requires the offence must be
proved on clear and convincing evidence, which he asserts is a higher standard than on a balance
of probabilities.

35.

A consideration of this issue requires a review of the history of the evidentiary standard

provided for in the Code and the applicable legal requirements.
36.

The first iteration of the Code came into existence in 1974. At the time, Tribunal

decisions were rendered by a jury and the Code required that "the onus and standard of proof that
an alleged offence has been committed by the accused shall be the same as in criminal cases".
37.

In 1995 the Code was comprehensively amended. Cases were no longer decided by

Junes. And the standard of proof was amended to be as it remains today:

C. II. (a.) 9. The onus of proof shall be on the prosecutor, who must show on clear
and convincing evidence that the accused has committed the alleged offence.
38.

In its submissions, the Provost noted that since this amendment the Tribunal and the

Discipline Appeals Board have exclusively applied a single civil standard of proof and provided
a list of 44 such cases (which list is reproduced as Schedule A to these Reasons for Decision).
The first of these decisions was in March 2009.
39.

Earlier, in 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada considered at length the proper standard of

proof to be applied in civil cases in C. (R.) v. McDougall, 2008 S.C.C. 53. It concluded that in
civil cases there is only one standard of proof:
40. Like the House of Lords, I think it is time to say, once and for all in Canada,
that there is only one civil standard of proof at common law and that is proof on a
balance of probabilities. Of course, context is all important and a judge should not
be unmindful, where appropriate, of inherent probabilities or improbabilities or the

- 11 seriousness of the allegations or consequences. However, these considerations do
not change the standard of proof....
46. Similarly, evidence must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent
to satisfy the balance of probabilities test. But again, there is no objective standard
to measure sufficiency.
49. In the result, I would reaffirm, that in civil cases there is only one standard of
proof and that is proof on the balance of probabilities. In all civil cases, the trial
judge must scrutinize the relevant evidence with care to determine whether it is
more likely than not that an alleged event occurred.
40.

The 44 cases cited by the Provost were all decided after McDougall in the Supreme Court

of Canada. It is probably not surprising, therefore, that they have all concluded that the
applicable standard of proof for proceedings under the Code is that which McDougall established
for civil cases, namely proof on a balance of probabilities.

41.

A typical holding is found in Discipline Appeals Board decision #497 in March of 2009:

17. We do not think there is any question that the applicable standard of proof for
proceedings under the Code is according to a civil standard- on a balance of
probabilities. Unlike in criminal cases, there is no presumption of innocence.
However, the requirement to prove the case on the balance of probabilities does
not detract from the requirement found in the Code and in the common law that the
standard must be met by evidence that is clear, convincing and cogent.
42.

The issue raised on this appeal is whether this line of authority must be reconsidered and

indeed overturned, on the basis of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Penner v.

Niagara Regional Services, 2013 SCC 19 and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Jacobs v. Ottawa
Police Service.

43.

The issue the Supreme Court of Canada had to decide in Penner was whether issue

estoppel applied in circumstances where police officers had been acquitted under the Police

Services Act and were subsequently faced with civil claims.

- 12 44.

The Court concluded (at paragraph 60):

... because the PSA requires that misconduct by a police officer be "proved on
clear and convincing evidence" ... it follows that such a conclusion might,
depending upon the nature of the factual findings, properly preclude re-litigation of
the issue of liability in a civil action where the balance of probabilities - a lower
standard of proof - would apply. However, this cannot be said in the case of an
acquittal. The prosecutor's failure to prove the charges by "clear and convincing
evidence" does not necessarily mean that those same allegations could not be
established on a balance of probabilities. Given the different standards of proof,
there would have been no reason for a complainant to expect that issue estoppel
would apply ifthe officers were acquitted. Indeed, in Porter, at para. 11, the Court
refused to apply issue estoppel following an acquittal in a police disciplinary
hearing because the hearing officer's decision "was determined by a higher
standard of proof and might have been different if it had been decided based on the
lower civil standard".
45.

The finding that the "clear and convincing" standard of proof in the Police Services Act

was a higher standard of proof than the balance of probabilities is somewhat confusing in light of
the McDougall case. This is all the more so, as the Supreme Court of Canada did not refer to the
McDougall case in its decision in Penner.

46.

The apparent contradiction seems to have been reconciled by the decision of the Court of

Appeal for Ontario in Jacobs v. Ottawa Police Service, referred to above. The Court of Appeal
concluded that the McDougall decision was a determination of the civil standard of proof in a
civil claim at common law. But, the Court held, it was well settled that it was within the
authority of a legislature to create a standard of proof specific to a particular statute. The Court
concluded that the Police Services Act was such a statute and it established a standard of proof in
PSA hearings requiring clear and convincing proof, and not proof on a balance of probabilities.

47.

In cogent submissions for the Student, his counsel submitted that the Code, like the

Police Services Act, has established an intermediate standard of proof, higher than a proof on a

- 13 -

balance of probabilities. He noted that the words in issue are accompanied by a heading "Onus
and Standard of Proof', that the provision is expressed in language suggesting that it is dealing
with a standard of proof rather than a method of demonstration, and that to interpret the language
as effecting the civil standard of proof, namely a balance of probabilities, would render the
words "on clear and convincing evidence", as mere surplusage. To do otherwise, he said, would
mean that the Tribunal would otherwise accept evidence that was unclear and unconvincing in
quality.

48.

The Provost, on the other hand, asserts that there is no statutory regime similar to the

Police Services Act establishing a standard of proof in University of Toronto Tribunal hearings.

The Provost's counsel asserts that the Tribunal is governed solely by the Code, which he
characterizes as an internal University policy that must be interpreted and administered within
the mainstream of civil and administrative law, including the McDougall standard of proof for
civil cases.
49.

These submissions by the Provost have given this Appeal Panel considerable pause.

However, we have concluded that we cannot agree that the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters is simply a statement of policy. Nor do we think it is simply a set of rules of procedure

such as those referred to in another case relied upon by the Provost, The Law Society of Upper
Canada vs. Sriskanda. In that case the Law Society Tribunal Appeal Division held that Jacobs

had no application to the standard of proof on the issues before it as there was no provision in the
Law Society Act comparable to those in the Police Services Act. Apparently the rules of

evidence that were employed before the Tribunal were contained in an internal policy document
entitled Rules of Practice and Procedure.

- 14 50.

However, in this case we are dealing with the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters

which, though not itself a statute, is enacted pursuant to an express delegation of statutory power.
51.

As is helpfully summarized in University Tribunal Decision# 1997-98-04, as a result of

the successive statutory provisions of the University of Toronto Act, 1947, and the University of
Toronto Act, 1971, the conduct and discipline of the students of the University of Toronto,

including the creation of disciplinary offences and penalties are delegated by those statutes to the
Governing Council of the University of Toronto. The Governing Council has exercised that
authority, in part, by enacting the Code. We cannot accept that the creation of offences, penalties
for those offences, and the procedure to be adopted in determining whether those offences have
been committed are valid exercises of the statutory authority delegated to Governing Council,
but the creation of the relevant standard of proof is not.
52.

An illustration of this principle is that for many years, as noted above, the Code imposed,

without challenge, a criminal standard of proof on disciplinary proceedings under the Code. If
one accepts, as Penner and Jacobs indicate, that some intermediate standard of proof can be
created by statute, we cannot accept that it is within the statutory authority of Governing Council
to impose the basic civil standard of proof, a balance of probabilities, or a criminal standard of
proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, but not anything in between.
53.

However, that by no means disposes of the issue before us.

54.

We are still left with the fundamental question of interpretation, namely what is meant,

once the onus of proof is placed on the prosecutor in section C.II.(a)(9) by the requirement that
the prosecutor "show on clear and convincing evidence that the accused has committed the
alleged offence". Unlike in the Penner and Jacobs cases requiring an offence to be "proved on

- 15 clear and convincing evidence", the provisions of the Code separate the description of the onus
of proof and the description of the evidence used to meet that onus. Is that separation
significant?
55.

In all of the circumstances, we have concluded that it is. The section can be read as

describing where the onus of proof (according to the ordinary civil standard of balance of
probabilities) rests, and then describing the kind of evidence that should be led to meet that onus.
Without more, we do not think such a description of the onus and the nature of the evidence to be
led to discharge that onus effects an elevation of the standard of proof.
56.

This is particularly so given that this is precisely the interpretation that has been given to

this section of the Code in at least 44 decisions of the Tribunal and the Discipline Appeals Board
in the last decade. These decisions are known to the Governing Council. Many of those
decisions address issues (for example a recommendation for expulsion, or degree withdrawal)
which must be finally determined by Governing Council. As well, Governing Council receives
reports of the decisions of the Tribunal and Discipline Appeals Board.
57.

If the Governing Council had intended through the use of the language in section

C.II(a)(a) of the Code to impose a different standard of proof than the one expressly described
and used in those 44 cases, one might reasonably have expected, through a reenactment of the
Code provisions or otherwise, that Governing Council would have made that clear.

58.

Moreover, the ordinary civil standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities, is, as has

been noted in many articles and judgments, a concept that is much more clearly able to be
described and understood than the rather more enigmatic and uncertain standard of proof "on
clear and convincing evidence". Indeed, although the Penner and Jacobs cases both hold that

- 16 "proof on clear and convincing evidence" is a higher standard than the ordinary civil standard,
they offer no further assistance or explanation of what that standard is.

59.

The conceptual difficulties of a Tribunal forced to adopt an intermediate standard of

proof are illustrated in the McDougall decision:

43. An intermediate standard of proof presents practical problems. As expressed
by L. Rothstein et al., at p. 466:
As well, suggesting that the standard of proof is "higher" than the "mere
balance of probabilities" leads one inevitably to inquire what percentage of
probability must be met? This is unhelpful because while the concept of
"51 % probability" or "more likely than not" can be understood by decision
makers, the concept of 60% or 70% probability cannot.
44. Put another way, it would seem incongruous for a judge to conclude that it
was more likely than not that an event occurred, but not sufficiently likely to some
unspecified standard and therefore that it did not occur. As Lord Hoffman
explained In re B at para. 2:

If a legal rule requires a fact to be proved (a "fact in issue"), a judge or jury
must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding
that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which
the only values are zero and one. The fact either happened or it did not. If
the Tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or
the other catTies the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of
proof fails to discharge it, a value of zero is returned and the fact is treated
as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of one is returned
and the fact is treated as having happened.
In my view, the only practical way in which to reach a factual conclusion in a civil
case is to decide whether it is more likely or not that the event occutTed.
60.

The continuation of the existing standard of proof- on a balance of probabilities -

provides a standard that can be clearly expressed and understood. This is a factor not to be
dismissed by any tribunal which has to wrestle with issues of standard of proof, but particularly
by the Tribunal charged with enforcing the provisions of the Code, given that the majority of the
members of the Tribunal are not lawyers.

- 17 We do not consider that this determination of the standard of proof renders the need to

61.

meet that standard of proof by "clear and convincing evidence" as "mere surplusage" as the
Student has suggested. Rather, we consider those words to be a salutary emphasis for the
Tribunals and in particular for their non-lawyer members, as to the quality of evidence which
should be led before a member of the University can be found to have committed the serious
offence of violating the Code ofBehaviour on Academic Matters.

In the result, we have concluded that the standard of proof set by the Code of Behaviour

62.

on Academic Matters is the ordinary civil standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities. Our
conclusion is based on:

•

the potential ambiguity introduced by the differences in the wording employed in the

Code and in the statute considered in the Penner and Jacobs cases;
•

more importantly, a consistent and substantial body of Tribunal and Appeal Board
authority which has interpreted the standard of proof found in the Code in this manner
over multiple cases and many years and which interpretation has been accepted by the
Governing Council who is the author of that standard; and

•

the salutary effect of a standard of proof that can be clearly expressed to and understood
by the members of the University whose conduct will be judged according to that
standard and the members of the Tribunal charged with enforcing it.

63.

It follows that we consider that the standard was correctly explained in the reference of

the Discipline Appeals Board decision number 497, quoted at paragraph 41 above. If we have
misinterpreted the intentions of the Governing Council in its enactment of the Code, there are
avenues available to change the Code.

- 18 -

64.

However, even if we have misinterpreted the intentions of Governing Council, in the

particular circumstances of this case, we have concluded that the result would not be different,
even if the Student is correct and the standard of proof is higher.
65.

It would not be appropriate for us to make such a determination if the issues in this case

turned on finely tuned assessments of credibility. In such a case the impact of a higher standard
of proof should only be assessed at the Tribunal level where the resulting impact on the
credibility assessments could properly be made.
66.

However, this is not a case where the determination of the Student's liability turns on any

such credibility assessment.
67.

As noted above, the Student admits in his factum that he did not address the allegations

raised by the first offence in his testimony, and he has offered no explanation for failing to
produce copies of the purported articles at the original hearing or at any time subsequently.
68.

With respect to the second charge, as noted above, the Student in his evidence effectively

admitted that he had received the disciplinary letter in its original form, and was confused by the
language which was omitted in the incomplete copy of the letter which he subsequently
submitted, the foundation of the first offence. In other words, the finding that the letter he
resubmitted to the University differed from the version that he acknowledged he had received is
based on the Student's evidence, not in conflict with it.
69.

Further, as noted in the Provost's factum on this appeal, the Student has not attempted to

tender any fresh evidence that could either establish the existence of either of the articles that he

- 19 cited in the research paper or explain how or why the disciplinary letter he admitted he received
in its original fo rm became altered before he resubmitted it.

70.

In all of the circumstances, we conclude that even if we are wrong and the Tribunal

should have applied the higher standard of prnof set out in Penner and Jacobs and submitted by
the Student, there is no basis to conclude that the result in this case would be any different.

71.

For these reasons, we dismiss the appeal.

"Burden of Proof" issue

Appeal by the Provost from a

"We do not think there is any question that
the applicable standard of proof for
proceedings under the Code is according to
a civil standard - on a balance of
probabilities. Unlike in criminal cases, there
is no presumption of innocence. However,
the requirement to prove the case on the
balance of probabilities does not detract from
the requirement found in the Code and in the
common law that the standard must be met
by evidence that is clear, convincing and
cogent" (para 17)

•

"While not questioning the credibility of the
Professor's evidence, the Tribunal concluded
that the evidence did no establish the offense
because the offense was not 'determined
conclusively or by necessary inference,' was
not accompanied by 'independent
corroboration' and that the evidence had not
eliminated the 'many possibilities that are
inconsistent with an inference of guilt.' These
requirements strongly suggest that the
Tribunal was requiring the University to prove
the case to a standard higher than a balance
of probabilities" (para 22)

•

"The University must satisfy us, on a balance
of probabilities, with clear and cogent
evidence, that this is what occurred. See
University of Toronto v X, a decision of the
Discipline Appeal Board, March 25, 2009 and
F.H. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53" (para 21).

•

"The Tribunal accepts that the Provost need
only prove her case on a balance of
probabilities, albeit on clear and convincing
evidence. The burden is simply on a balance
of probabilities. The requirement of clear and
convincing evidence simply illuminates the

civil standard" (para 23)

   Student charged with two offences under s. B.i.1(d), two offences under
   s. B.i.1(b), and in the alternative, two offences under s. B.i.3(b).
   The first set of charges related to allegations that the Student had
   obtained a copy of the Answer Key to a homework assignment, used the
   Key as an unauthorized aid, and included verbatim or nearly verbatim
   excerpts from the Key without reference or attribution to the course
   instructor. The second set of charges related to a different course and
   involved allegations that the Student obtained a copy of another
   studentâs assignment, used this assignment as an unauthorized aid and
   included verbatim or nearly verbatim excerpts from the assignment
   without reference or attribution to the other student. The Student
   pleaded guilty and the matter proceeded by way of an Agreed Statement
   of Facts. The Panel accepted the Studentâs guilty plea with regards to
   both offences under s. B.i.1(b). However, the Panel accepted the
   Studentâs guilty plea with regards to only one of the two offences
   under s. B.i.1(d). The Panel accepted that use of the Answer Key from a
   previous year constituted use of an unauthorized aid but concluded that
   an additional offence of plagiarism was not supported by the facts. The
   University withdrew the two alternative charges. The parties presented
   a Joint Submission on Penalty. The Student had admitted guilt to the
   Deanâs Designate and cooperated with the University in entering her
   guilty plea. The Student had been sanctioned on a prior occasion for
   the use of unauthorized assistance relating to three homework
   assignments. The Panel noted that this prior offence was a very serious
   aggravating factor given that it involved similar misconduct. The Panel
   accepted the Joint Submission on Penalty and imposed a final grade of
   zero in two courses, a suspension for just under three years, a
   notation on the Studentâs transcript for just under three years, and
   ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

   The Student was charged under s. B.i.3(a) of the‚ØCode of Behaviour on
   Academic Matters, 1995‚Ø(the ‚Code‚) on the basis that the Student
   knowingly forged or in any other way altered or falsified an academic
   record, and/or uttered, circulated or made use of such forged, altered
   or falsified record, namely, a document which purported to be the
   Student‚s unofficial academic history from the University of Toronto.

   The Student did not attend the hearing and counsel for the University
   provided the Panel with an email chain which confirmed that the Student
   was aware of the hearing but was not able to attend. The Student
   further confirmed that they were waiving their right to attend the
   hearing and agreed that the Tribunal should proceed in their absence.
   The Panel noted that the Student had also previously communicated via
   email with counsel for the University to advise that they would not be
   at the hearing. Based on the evidence, and considering rules 9(c), 13,
   16, and 17 of the University Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and
   Procedure, the Panel was satisfied that the Student was served with the
   charge and the Notice of Electronic Hearing, and ordered that the
   hearing proceed in the absence of the Student.

   The Panel received affidavit evidence of a Student Success
   Representative in the Office of the Registrar (the ‚Representative‚).
   The Representative‚s affidavit outlined that she received a call from a
   Pre-Employment Screening Coordinator with BMO Financial Group (‚BMO‚)
   seeking to confirm the authenticity of a transcript of academic record
   provided by the Student as part of a job application (the ‚Purported
   Transcript‚). Upon review of the Purported Transcript, the
   Representative she determined the Purported Transcript had been
   falsified. The Panel noted that the requirement that the Student act
   ‚knowingly‚ is made out if the Student ought reasonably to have known
   that the academic record in question had been forged, altered or
   falsified. The Panel determined that the evidence clearly established
   that the Purported Transcript provided by the Student to BMO was false.
   Furthermore, the Panel found that it was more likely than not that the
   Student was responsible for circulating and making use of the forged
   record since there was evidence that the Student had provided it to
   BMO. Based on the foregoing, the Panel found the Student guilty of
   forging or in any other way altering or falsifying an academic record,
   and/or uttering, circulating or making use of such forged, altered or
   falsified record, contrary to section B.i.3(a) of the Code.

   In determining sanction, the Panel noted that the Code confirms that in
   the case of forgery or falsification of an academic record, the Provost
   will ask the Tribunal to recommend expulsion. The Panel further noted
   that it is required to consider the factors¬  outlined in the
   University of Toronto v. Mr. C (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5, 1976).
   The Panel noted that the Student did not meaningfully participate in
   the academic discipline process or in this proceeding nor did the
   Student sign an Agreed Statement of Facts when given the opportunity.
   The Panel considered the Student‚s prior sanction as an aggravating
   factor in determining the appropriate penalty. The Panel noted that
   even if it was to accept as admissible, the expressions of remorse made
   by the Student in his emails to counsel for the University, those
   statements do not describe any extenuating circumstances faced by the
   Student at the time of the commission of the offence. Furthermore,
   those statements do not mitigate what the Tribunal considers to be
   premeditated and egregious conduct of the Student in circulating a
   false academic record as part of a job application. In reviewing the
   case law provided by counsel for the University, the Panel observed
   that these cases establish that forgery of an academic record is one of
   the most serious offences a student can commit. Based on the foregoing
   and all of the circumstances, the Panel concluded that it was
   appropriate to make a recommendation for expulsion. The Panel imposed
   the following sanctions: immediate suspension from the University for a
   period of up to five years; a recommendation that the Student be
   expelled, as per s. C.ii(b)(i) of Code; and a report to the Provost for
   publication.

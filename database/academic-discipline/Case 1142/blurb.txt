Trial Division – s. B.i.3(a) of Code – forged and falsified record – Student knowingly forged or falsified an academic record uttered, circulated or made use of such forged, altered or falsified record, namely a document which purported to be an unofficial academic history from the University of Toronto – Student did not attend the hearing – Rules 9(c), 13, 16, and 17 of the University Tribunal’s Rules of Practice and Procedure – Panel was satisfied the hearing could proceed in the Student’s absence – the unofficial academic history provided to a prospective employer was altered, forged or falsified – finding of guilt – forgery of an academic record is one of the most serious offences a student can commit – the expressions of remorse made by the Student in his emails to counsel for the University do not describe any extenuating circumstances faced by the Student at the time of the offence – Statements made by the Student do not mitigate the premeditated and egregious conduct of circulating a false academic record – immediate suspension from the University for a period of up to five years; a recommendation that the Student be expelled, as per s. C.ii(b)(i) of Code; and a report to the Provost for publication.

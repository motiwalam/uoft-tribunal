Trial Division – s. B.i.l(b) of Code – unauthorized aid – Student knew or ought to have reasonably known that he possessed an unauthorized aid sheet in connection with a final examination – penalty hearing – unusual seven-month delay between the finding and the penalty hearing was due partly to Covid-19 pandemic - threshold to reject a joint submission had not been met given the very unusual circumstances of the global pandemic, the implications on the Student’s life and the presence of mitigating factors - the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic resulted in acceptance of the JSP that results in a suspension, which, while intended to be three years, in practical effect was substantially less - Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) – Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”) - grade assignment of zero in the course - suspension from the University from the date the Panel made its order until August 30, 2022 - four-year notation on the transcript -  report to Provost for publication with the Student’s name withheld.

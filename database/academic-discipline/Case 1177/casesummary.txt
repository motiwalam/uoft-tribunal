   The Student wasÂ chargedÂ withÂ fourteenÂ counts underÂ theÂ Code of
   Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995â¯(theÂ âCodeâ). The charges are as
   follows:Â (1) two counts ofÂ knowingly representing as herÂ own, an
   idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another in two
   assignments, contrary to s. B.i.1(d) of the Code; (2) one count of
   knowingly using or possessing an unauthorized aid or obtaining
   unauthorized assistance in connection with a test, contrary to s.
   B.i.1(b) of the Code, and (3) five counts ofÂ knowingly forgingÂ or in
   any other way alteringÂ orÂ falsifyingÂ a documentÂ or evidence
   required by the University of Toronto, or uttering, circulatingÂ or
   makingÂ use of such forged,Â altered or falsified document, namely,
   aÂ medicalÂ certificateÂ in support of a petition to lift a three-year
   academic suspension.Â In the alternative, the Student was
   chargedÂ withÂ four counts ofÂ knowingly engagingÂ in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct,Â fraudÂ or
   misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or other academic
   advantageÂ contrary toÂ s. B.i.3(b)Â of theÂ CodeÂ and two counts of
   knowingly using or possessing an unauthorized aid or obtaining
   unauthorized assistance in connection with a test, contrary to s.
   B.i.1(b) of the Code.

   The Student attended the hearingÂ but declined the opportunity to speak
   at all stages of theÂ hearing. The Student and the University submitted
   an Agreed Statement of Fact (âASFâ), a Joint Book of Documents (âJBDâ),
   an Agreed Statement of Fact on PenaltyÂ (âASFPâ) and a Joint Submission
   on Penalty (âJSPâ).Â The Panel noted thatÂ the Student agreed to all
   the facts, pled guilty to all the charges, and agreed to the penalties
   sought by the University.Â In view of the ASF, the admissions of the
   Student including the guilty plea, the Panel concluded that the
   University had established the violation of the Code with respect to
   all eight charges. Based on this finding, the University withdrewÂ the
   six charges made in the alternative.

   Counsel for the University made brief submission in support of the
   JSP.Â The Panel noted that Counsel for the University pointed them to
   the high threshold established in the jurisprudence to depart from
   aÂ joint submission.Â AÂ departure from aÂ joint submissionÂ should
   only be done in cases where the joint submission
   wasÂ trulyÂ unreasonable or unconscionable (University of Toronto and
   S.F.Â (Case No.: 690, October 20, 2014) at paras. 16,Â 18, 20 and 22;
   andÂ University of Toronto and M.A.Â (Case No.: 837, December 22,
   2016).Â The Panel noted that the JSP in this case was not unreasonable
   or unconscionable.

   CounselÂ reviewedÂ the traditional factors established in the
   jurisprudence to be considered in determining sanction. The University
   conceded that the Student had admitted her guilt at the first
   opportunity and cooperated throughout the UniversityâsÂ discipline
   process by pleading guilty, thereby accepting some ownership and
   responsibility of her actions.Â However, the Panel noted that this was
   more than outweighed by the otherÂ factors when they were properly
   weighed and considered. The PanelÂ observed thatÂ there was a
   legitimate concern about the likelihood of repetitionÂ of the conduct
   since there had been a prior offence and eight offences that repeated
   themselves in a very shortÂ period of timeÂ over several months.Â The
   PanelÂ noted that there were notÂ any mitigating circumstances, nor
   were any identified.Â Upon review of the nature of the offences, the
   detriment to the University and the need for general deterrence the
   Panel noted thatÂ they all weighed heavily in favour of accepting the
   JSP. Both plagiarism and unauthorized assistance are very serious
   offences that undermine the teaching and learning experience of the
   University which, therefore, warrant strong messages of general
   deterrence.Â The PanelÂ discussed that forgery had repeatedly been
   found in the jurisprudence to be among the most serious offences
   (University of Toronto and Y.K.Â (Case No.: 855, March 10, 2017) at
   para. 39).Â Furthermore, the forgeries were of medical certificates
   whichÂ impairs theÂ Universityâs processes to accommodate
   disabilities.Â The Panel noted that the offences were aggravated by the
   fact that the medical certificates were purchased.Â Upon review of the
   relevant case law, the Panel accepted theÂ JSP.Â The Panel imposed the
   following sanctions:Â a final grade of zero in the affected courses;Â a
   five-year suspension or until Governing Council makes its decision on
   expulsion, whichever comes first;Â a correspondingÂ notation on the
   transcript;Â recommendation that the Student be expelled, as per
   s.Â C.ii.(b)(i) of Code; report to Provost for publication.

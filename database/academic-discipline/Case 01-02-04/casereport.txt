REASONS FOR DECISION
[1]
A hearing of the Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened at 5:00 p.m. on
Wednesday, February 27, 2002, in the Board Room, Simcoe Hall, to consider six charges under
the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters laid against S.S. by letter dated July 13, 2001 from
the Vice-President and Provost, Professor Adel Sedra. At the commencement of the hearing Ms.
Harmer advised that the University was not proceeding on counts 4 through 6 respectively,
leaving the following three charges against Mr. S.:
1. On or about April 12, 2001, you did knowingly forge or in any other way alter or falsify
any academic record, and/or did knowingly utter, circulate or make use of any such
forged, altered or falsified record, whether the record be in print or electronic form

IN THE MATTER OF DISCPLINARY CHARGES AGAINST MR. S.
contrary to Section B.I.3(a) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995.
Pursuant to Section B of the Code you are deemed to have acted knowingly if you ought
reasonably to have known that you forged or in any other way altered or falsified any
academic record, and/or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or
falsified record, whether the record be in print or electronic form. In particular, you
created and/or sent a document that purported to be a University of Toronto Transcript of
Consolidated Academic Record to the Pennsylvania College of Optometry as part of your
application for admission to that institution. This document was not in fact an official
University of Toronto Transcript of Consolidated Academic Record. The document that
you created and/or submitted to the College misrepresented some of the course that you
had taken at the University of Toronto. The details of the misrepresentations are set out
in a table accompanying these charges. [Appendix A to the Reasons for Decision]
2. On or about April 12, 2001, you did knowingly forge or in any other way alter or falsify
any academic record, or did knowingly utter, circulate or make use of any such forged,
altered or falsified record, whether the record be in print or electronic form contrary to
section B.I.3(a) of the Code of Conduct on Academic Matters, 1995. Pursuant to Section
B of the Code you are deemed to have acted knowingly if you ought reasonably to have
known that you forged or in any other way altered or falsified any academic record,
and/or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or falsified record,
whether the record be in print or electronic form. In particular, you created and/or
submitted a letter that purported to be a letter of recommendation from M. Filosa, Ph.D.
in support of your application to the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. Filosa did not
write this letter in support of your application.
3. On or about April 12, 2001, you did knowingly forge or in any other way alter or falsify
any academic record, or did knowingly utter, circulate or make use of any such forged,
altered or falsified record, whether the record be in print or electronic form contrary to
section B.I.3(a) of the Code of Conduct on Academic Matters, 1995. Pursuant to Section
B of the Code you are deemed to have acted knowingly if you ought reasonably to have
known that you forged or in any other way altered or falsified any academic record,
and/or uttered, circulated or made use of any such forged, altered or falsified record,
whether the record be in print or electronic form. In particular, you created and/or
submitted a letter that purported to be a letter of recommendation from Professor Ron
Dengler in support of your application to the Pennsylvania College of Optometry.
Professor Dengler did not write this letter in support of your application.
[2]
An Agreed Summary of Facts dated February 27, 2002 and signed by Mr. S., Mr.
Henderson, and Ms. Harmer was admitted into evidence. The Agreed Summary of Facts
provided the following details:
1. During the period 1997 (Fall Session) to 2001 (Winter Session) Mr. S. completed four
years (8 sessions) of an Honours Bachelor of Science Degree at the University of Toronto
Page 2 of 7

IN THE MATTER OF DISCPLINARY CHARGES AGAINST MR. S.
at Scarborough. He made a request to graduate, and was scheduled to graduate on June
14, 2001.
2. On or about April 12, 2001, Mr. S. applied for admission to the Pennsylvania College of
Optometry in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania (“the College”).
3. With that application Mr. S. submitted the following documents:
(i)

A document entitled “University of Toronto Transcript of Consolidated Academic
Record – Student Copy” which purported to be an official transcript from the
University of Toronto containing a summary of Mr. S.’s academic record;

(ii)

A letter of reference/evaluation purporting to be signed by Professor Ron
Dengler;

(iii)

A letter of reference/evaluation purporting to be signed by Professor Michael
Filosa;

(iv)

A letter of reference/evaluation signed by Professor L. Sawchuk.

4. Professors Dengler and Filosa received a letter from the Director of Admissions at the
College thanking them for the provision of the letters of evaluation. This was the first
indication either professor had that Mr. S. had applied for admission to the College, and
that in so doing he had submitted letters in support of Mr. S. purporting to be authored by
them.
5. Upon investigation, the University learned that Mr. S. had also submitted a false
transcript to the College. A comparison of that false transcript with Mr. S.’s official
University Transcript revealed that Mr. S. altered the information in 42 different
instances. The details of those alterations are described in the Table attached as
Appendix A [Appendix A to the Reasons For Decision].
6. Mr. S. acknowledges that he manufactured the false “University of Toronto at
Scarborough” letterhead on which the Filosa and Dengler letters are printed, he made-up
the contents of those letters, which content was false, and he forged the signatures of
Professor Filosa and Professor Dengler on those letters.
7. Mr. S. also acknowledges that he created the false University of Toronto transcript
submitted by him to the College. In particular, he admits that in creating the false
transcript he forged, altered and falsified his academic record in 42 instances as described
in the Table attached as Appendix A. [Appendix A to the Reasons for Decision].

IN THE MATTER OF DISCPLINARY CHARGES AGAINST MR. S.
8. Mr. S. acknowledges that he knowingly forged, altered and falsified the academic records
as described above, and knowingly circulated and made use of the forged, altered and
falsified records contrary to section B.I.3(a) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters (the “Code”). As such, he acknowledges that he is guilty of charge numbers 1, 2
and 3 contained in the University’s letter to him of July 13, 2001.
[4]
Following deliberations, the Panel was satisfied that Mr. S. is guilty of charges 1 through
3 detailed above.
SANCTION
[5]
The bulk of the hearing was devoted to this issue. The University asked for a
recommendation of expulsion under Section C.II.(b)(1)(i) of the Code. If accepted by Governing
Council, the expulsion would be recorded on Mr. S.'s academic record and transcript
permanently. The University also requested that we report the case to the Provost under s.
C.II.(b)(3) for publication in University newspapers. Mr. S., through his representative,
submitted that the appropriate sanction was a four-year suspension under s. C.II.(b)(1)(h),
together with recording for the same period as well as reporting to the Provost for publication.
[6]
The University did not call any evidence. Mr. Henderson provided some information
concerning his client. Mr. S. was just 16 years old when he entered the University, having
skipped two grades. He made what were characterized as significant contributions to the
University during his four years as a student, through his participation in the creation of three CD
ROMs which were admitted as Exhibits 8 to 10, and through his work as News Editor for the
University of Toronto Pulse on line magazine.
[7]
This is a very serious case. It represents one of the most pervasive schemes of dishonest
conduct that we have seen, from our review of the extensive set of student discipline decisions at
this University that was provided to this Tribunal. Mr. S. engaged in a planned, deliberate and
extensive re-writing of his academic record, as well as the fabrication of two reference letters
from his professors. Through the 42 changes to his transcript and the creation of two
manufactured reference letters, he radically misrepresented the quality and details of his
mediocre performance at the University; the resulting account of his academic history at the
University bore little resemblance to reality.
[8]
There are only two similar cases among the dozens which were provided or summarized
during the hearing. Case number 1996/97-05 involved the falsification of many grades and
several documents over a lengthy period; Case number 1997/98-04 saw the submission of
several misleading pieces of admission information in order to re-tell the student's story in a way
that was knowingly false. Both cases resulted in a recommendation of expulsion, as well as
notation and reporting.

IN THE MATTER OF DISCPLINARY CHARGES AGAINST MR. S.
[9]
The same sanctions must be applied in this case. The admitted acts display a significant
element of deceit. While these were “first offences”, in fact there were three, and they were
undoubtedly time-consuming, conscious and extensive projects, involving the production of false
transcripts and letters, including a watermark, letterhead and signatures. There are some
mitigating circumstances: Mr. S.’s admission of his actions when he was first confronted by the
University, and his guilty pleas before the Tribunal; and our concern about the finality of
expulsion and its impact on a student who was about to graduate at age 20. It is difficult to assess
the likelihood of repetition; the planning and effort which were evidenced in Mr. S.'s actions
suggest a willingness to threaten the evaluation process and the integrity of the University
community.
[10] Most important, in our view, are the considerations of detriment to the University and
general deterrence. Any university evaluation system is vulnerable to such acts of deception, and
has suffered enormously in this case. Moreover, this Tribunal must convey the message that
strong measures will be taken against persons who falsify University records. Only in this way
can such actions be prevented in the future.
[11] We therefore recommend to the President that Mr. S. be expelled from the University.
We wish to report this case to the Provost for purposes of publication.

March 24, 2002
I certify that this is the decision of the Panel

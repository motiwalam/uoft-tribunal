The Facts

1.

This hearing arose out of charges of academic misconduct dated July 28, 2016

("Charges") filed by the Provost of the University of Toronto (the "Provost") under the
Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters ("Code"). For the purposes of this hearing the

Provost, and A

K

("Mr. K

") prepared an Agreed Statement of Facts ("ASF")

and a joint book of documents ("JBD").
2.

Mr. K

confirmed that he signed the ASF freely and voluntarily, knowing of the

potential consequences he faced.
3.

Mr. K

also acknowledged that he had received reasonable notice of this

hearing. The Notice of Hearing for March 21, 2017 set out the Charges. They read as
follows:
1.
On or about March 31, 2015, you . knowingly submitted, without the

-

academic advantage in connection with the final examination in CSC108H5,
contrary to section B. l.3(b) of the Code.
4.

As stated above, the parties provided the Panel with an Agreed Statement of

Facts ("ASF") concerning the charges. Significantly, the ASF included a plea of guilty.
The ASF reads as follows:

Guilty plea

1.

Mr. K
admits that he received a copy of the charges filed by the
Provost. A copy of the charges is included in the JBD at Tab 1.

2.

Mr. K
admits that he received a copy of the notice of hearing in this
matter and that he has received reasonable notice of this hearing. A copy
of the notice of hearing is included in the JBD at Tab 2.

3.

Mr. K
waives the reading of the charges filed against him, and pleads
guilty to charges #2 and #4.

4.

The Provost agrees that if the Tribunal convicts Mr. K
of charges #2
and #4, the Provost will withdraw charges #1 , #3 and #5.

5.

At all material times, Mr. K
was a registered student at the University of
Toronto Mississauga. A copy of Mr. K
's academic record, as of March
14, 2017, is included in the JBD at Tab 3.

CSC108H5 in Fall 2014: Assignment 3 (Previously Resolved)

6.

In Fall 2014, Mr. K
enrolled in CSC1 08H5 (Introduction to Computer
Programming), which was taught by Professor Daniel Zingaro, Andrew
Petersen and Tiffany Tong. A copy of the course syllabus for the course in
Fall 201 4 is included in the JBD at Tab 4.

7.

Students in the course were required to submit Assignment ·3, which was
worth 9% of their final grade, by November 25, 201 4. A copy of the
instructions for Assignment 3 in Fall 201 4 is included in the JBD at Tab 5.

8.

Mr. K
submitted four files in the course in Fall 2014 as part of
Assignment 3: poetry_functions, poetry_reader, test_check_syllables, and
test_count_lines. A copy of the code that he submitted for Assignment 3 in
Fall 201 4 is included in the JBD at Tab 6.

9.

Mr. K
subsequently admitted that he had committed the offence of
unauthorized assistance in connection with his Assignment 3 in Fall 201 4,
and was sanctioned in respect of the offence.

CSC108H5 in Winter 2015: Assignment 3

1 0.

In Winter 201 5, Mr. K
enrolled in CSC1 08H5 (Introduction to Computer
Programming) again. The course was taught by Professor Zingaro in
Winter 201 5. A copy of the course syllabus for the course in Winter 201 5
is included in the JBD at Tab 7.

11.

Students in the course were required to submit Assignment 3, which was
worth 9% of their final grade, by March 31 , 201 5. A copy of the
instructions for Assignment 3 in Winter 201 5 is included in the JBD at Tab
8. The instructions for Assignment 3 in Winter 201 5 were similar in certain
respects to Assignment 3 in Fall 201 4.

1 2.

On or about March 31 , 201 5, Mr. K
submitted four files in the course in
Winter 201 5 as part of Assignment 3: poetry_functions, poetry_reader,
test_check_vowel_phoneme_counts, and test_count_vowel_phonemes. A
copy of the code that he submitted for Assignment 3 in Winter 201 5 is
included in the JBD at Tab 9.

1 3.

On review, Professor Zingaro determined that the code that Mr. K
had
submitted for Assignment 3 in Winter 201 5 (at Tab 9) contained code that
was the same or substantially similar to code that Mr. K
had previously
submitted for Assignment 3 in Fall 201 4 (at Tab 6). Copies of the code
that Mr. K
submitted in Fall 201 4 and Winter 201 5, which have been
highlighted to show the similarities between the two, are included in the
JBD at Tabs 10 and 11, respectively.

1 4.

Professor Zingaro observed that the differences between the code that Mr.
K
submitted in Fall 201 4 and Winter 201 5 were minor in nature (e.g.,
changes in the variables used) or arose from the differences in the
assignments. Professor Zingaro had previously advised students in the
Winter 201 5 course that if they wished to use code that they had written in
the past, they were required to include citations to their previous code in
their assignment. Mr. K
's Assignment 3 in Winter 201 5 did not contain
any citations.

1 5.

On April 30, 201 6, Mr. K
met with Professor Zingaro to discuss the
allegation of academic misconduct.

CSC108H5 in Fall 2015: Final Examination

1 6.

In. Fall 201 5, Mr. K
enrolled in CSC1 08H5 (Introduction to Computer
Programming) again. The course was taught by Tiffany Tong. A copy of
the course syllabus for the course in Fall 201 5 is included in the JBD at
Tab 12.

17.

On December 12, 2015, starting at 1 :00 pm, Mr. K
wrote the final
examination in the Course. The final examination was worth 45% of Mr.
K
's final grade in the Course.

18.

Students were not permitted to have any aids in the final examination.
Students were specifically advised by the exam invigilators that their cell
phones should be kept either in their backpacks or in clear plastic bags
that were provided to them.

19.

A copy of Mr. K
's examination paper is included in the JBD at Tab 13.
The front of the examination paper included the following warning to
students:
The University of Toronto Mississauga and you, as a student,
share a commitment to academic integrity. You are reminded
that you may be charged with an academic offence for
possessing any unauthorized aids during the writing of an exam.
Clear, sealable, plastic bags have been provided for all electronic
devices with storage, including but not limited to: cell phones,
SMART devices, tablets, laptops, calculators, and MP3 players.
Please turn off all devices, seal them in the bag provided and
place the bag under your desk for the duration of the
examination. You will not be able to touch the bag or its contents
until the exam is over.
If, during an exam, any of these items are found on your person
or in the area of your desk other than in the clear, sealable,
plastic bag, you may be charged with an academic offence. A
typical penalty for an academic offence may cause you to fail the
course.

22.

During the examination, Mr. K
signed out to use the washroom at 1 :54
pm. He signed back into the examination room at 2:01 pm. A copy of the
form that Mr. K
signed, which recorded his washroom break, is
included in the JBD at Tab14.
.

When Mr. K
signed out to use the washroom, he was accompanied by
one of the Chief Presiding Officers of the examination, Edward Ho. While
Mr. K
was in the washroom, Mr. Ho noticed that Mr. K
was taking a
longer than usual amount of time, and asked if he was alright. Mr. K
responded that he was.
When Mr. K
returned to the examination room, Mr. Ho asked Mr. K
to empty his pockets. Mr. K
produced a wallet from his left jean pocket
but did not immediately produce his cell phone, which was in his right jean
pocket. Mr. Ho saw the cell phone and asked Mr. K
to produce it,
which he did. The cell phone was off at the time.

23.

Mr. Ho completed an examination anomaly report setting out what had
happened. Mr. Ho asked Mr. K
to review the report and let him know if
Mr. K
disagreed with what was stated in the report. Mr. K
did not
disagree with the contents and signed the report. A copy of the
examination anomaly report completed by Mr. Ho and signed by Mr. K
is included in the JBD at Tab 15.

24.

Following the examination, Mr. K
signed a Possession of an
Unauthorized Aid During a Final Exam form before the cell phone was
returned to him. A copy of the signed form is included in the JBD at Tab
16.

Dean's Designate Meeting

25.

On March 29, 2016, Mr. K
met with Professor Michael Georges,
Dean's Designate for Academic Offences. Mr. K
acknowledges that
Professor Georges gave him the warning that was required to be given
under the Code.

26.

Mr. K
was represented by a law student from Downtown Legal
Services at the meeting. During the meeting:

(a)

Mr. K
denied that he had committed an academic offence in
connection with Assignment 3 in the course in Winter 2015.

(b)

Mr. K
's representative advised Professor Georges that Mr. K
was
not prepared to accept responsibility for the offence of using or possessing
an unauthorized aid under section B.1.1 (b) of the Code and that Mr. K
was not prepared to enter any plea in respect of the alleged offence.

27.

A copy of the Admission of Guilt forms signed by Mr. K
, indicating that
he was pleading "not guilty" to the alleged offence in Assignment 3 in the
course in Winter 2015 and that he was making "no plea" in respect of the
final examination in the course in Fall 2015 is included in the JBD at Tab
17.

Admissions and Acknowledgements

28.

Mr. K
admits that, by incorporating portions of his code (for which he
had obtained unauthorized assistance) in Fall 2014 in the code that he
submitted for Assignment 3 in the course in Winter 2015, he knowingly
obtained unauthorized assistance in connection with Assignment 3 in the
course in Winter 2015, contrary to section 8.1.1 (b) of the Code.

29.

Mr. K
admits that he knowingly possessed his cell phone during the
final examination in the Course and that his cell phone was an
unauthorized aid under the Code. Accordingly, Mr. K
admits that he

-

-

knowingly used or possessed an unauthorized aid in connection with the
final examination in the Course, contrary to section B.l.1 (b) of the Code.
30.

Mr. K

(a)

the Provost has advised Mr. K
he has done so; and

(b)

he is signing this ASF freely and voluntarily, knowing of the potential
consequences he faces.

acknowledges that:
of his right to obtain legal counsel, and

Finding of Guilt

5.

As noted in the ASF, Mr. K

waived the reading of the Charges and pied guilty

to Charges 2 and 4. The Tribunal accepted this plea and registered a finding of guilt on
Charges 2 and 4. On that basis, the Provost withdrew Charges 1 , 3 and 5.
Penalty

6. The parties also provided the Tribunal with an Agreed Statement of Fact on Penalty.
Through this, the Tribunal learned that Mr. K

had, in December, 201 4, been

disciplined on a prior occasion, again for the offence of obtaining unauthorized
assistance.

On that occasion, Mr. K

had admitted his guilt and had been assessed

a mark of zero in the course in question. In concluding her December 3, 2014 letter of
discipline, Professor Karshon, Chair of the Department of Mathematical and
Computational Sciences stated:
Finally, you should be aware that any subsequent
allegations of academic misconduct are usually referred to
the Office of the Dean or the Tribunal for investigation.
7.

The parties then made a joint submission on penalty. Specifically, the Provost and

Mr. K

submitted that the appropriate penalty in all the circumstances of the case was

that the University Tribunal impose the following sanctions on Mr. K
(a)

:

a final grade of zero in the course CSC1 08H5 in Winter 201 5;

-

8

-

(b)

a final grade of zero in the course CSC108H5 in Fall 2015;

(c)

a suspension from the University of Toronto for three years to commence
May 1, 2017, and to end April 30, 2020;

(d)

a notation of the sanction on his academic record and transcript from the
date of the Order until April 30, 2021.

8. The Parties further submitted that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to report
this case to the Provost for publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the
sanctions imposed in the University of Toronto newspapers, with the name of the
student withheld.
9. As stated in, for example, the case of S. M_. (Case No 819, June 8, 2016), a joint
submission on penalty should only be rejected in circumstances where to give it effect
would be contrary to the public interest or would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

In considering a joint submission on penalty, it is not the function of the

Panel to determine whether or not it agrees with the proposed sanction in the sense of
accepting that it would, itself, have imposed that sanction had the matter been left to it
to decide on its own. Rather, its task is to determine whether the outcome falls within a
range of reasonable outcomes, recognizing the institutional value, efficiency and
importance of outcomes that are achieved through such joint submissions.
10. In this case, the Panel accepted without difficulty the reasonableness of the
sanctions set out in paragraphs 5(a), 5(b), 5(c) and 6, above. It struggled, however,
with the proposal set out in paragraph 5(d) - the imposition of a notation of the sanction
on Mr. K

's academic record and transcript from the date of the Order only until April

30, 2021.

The Panel debated the sufficiency of this sanction as compared to the

imposition of a notation until his graduation from the University.
11. This concern was raised in our minds particularly in connection with the guidance
provided in the Tribunal's cases regarding the need to consider the likelihood of
recurrence in determining the appropriate (or, in our case, a reasonable) sanction.

-

Given Mr. K

9

-

's disregard of the warning he received from the Provost in the letter of

December 3, 201 4, we were concerned that the disappearance from his transcript of the
penalties for which we are responsible would constitute something of an invitation to
engage in further academic misconduct, particularly given the length of time it will take
Mr. K

to complete his degree should he decide to re-enrol at the University after his

suspension comes to an end.
12. Ultimately, however, we have concluded that this concern is not sufficient to
overcome our obligation to respect the institutional value in accepting joint submissions.
In this regard, we bear in mind that if Mr. K

chooses not to return to the University or

does not graduate, a notation until graduation would effectively become a permanent
academic scar.

While such permanent records of misconduct are certainly not

unprecedented, they are typically reserved for situations more egregious than the one
that presently confronts us.
13. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, and after hearing submissions by the
parties, the Tribunal concluded that the sanction proposed by the parties fell within a
reasonable range of sanctions for the offences committed. Accordingly, the Tribunal
hereby orders:
1. THAT Mr. K
(a)

is guilty of the academic offences of:

Knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection with an
assignment contrary-to section 8.1(1 )(b} of the Code of Behaviour
on Academic Matters;

(b)

and

Knowingly using or possessing an unauthorized aid in an
examination cqntrary to section 8.1.1(b) of the Code of Behaviour
on Academic Matters.

2.

THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on Mr. K

:

- 10 -

(a)

a final grade of zero in the course CSC108H5 in Winter 2015;

(b)

a final grade of zero in the course CSC108H5 in Fall 2015;

(c)

a suspension from the University of Toronto for three years to
commence May 1, 2017, and to end April 30, 2020;

(d)

a notation of the sanction on his academic record and transcript
from the date of the Decision until April 30, 2021.

3. THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of
the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the
University newspapers, with the name of the student withheld.

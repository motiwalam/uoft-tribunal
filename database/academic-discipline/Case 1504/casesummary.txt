   The Student was charged with knowingly forging or in any other way
   altering or falsifying an academic record, or uttering, circulating or
   making use of a forged, altered or falsified record, namely a document
   purporting to be a screenshot of the 'Payments' page from the Student's
   ACORN account, submitted contrary to section B.1.3(a) of the Code of
   Behaviour on Academic Matters (the ‚Code‚). In the alternative, the
   Student was charged with knowingly forging or in any other way altering
   or falsifying an academic record, or uttering, circulating or making
   use of a forged, altered or falsified record, contrary to section
   B.i.1(a) of the Code. In the further alternative, the Student knowingly
   engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
   or misrepresentation not otherwise described in order to obtain
   academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind, contrary to
   section B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   The Student was registered at UTSC. The Student submitted a document
   purporting to be a screenshot of their ACORN account showing a bank
   payment towards their tuition for the summer term (the "ACORN
   Screenshot") to the Registrar's Office. The ACORN Screenshot, however,
   was forged, altered or falsified, as the Student had not made any
   payment towards their Summer 2022 tuition. The Registrar's Office
   subsequently notified the Student about several discrepancies between
   the Screenshot and the University‚s records, and in particular, that
   the purported payment had not been made in satisfaction of an
   outstanding balance due for the summer term. The Registrar's Office
   submitted an academic integrity report. The Student did not attend
   their scheduled meeting with the Dean's Office.

   As part of an Agreed Statement of Facts, submitted jointly by the
   University and the Student, the Student admitted that the ACORN
   Screenshot, an academic record, had been knowingly forged, altered or
   falsified and had been submitted to the Office of the Registrar at
   UTSC. The Panel concluded, based on its review of the ASF and the
   University's Book of Documents, that the charge under s. B.1.3(a) of
   the Code was proven on a balance of probabilities. Accordingly, the
   University withdrew the two alternative charges.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered a Joint
   Submission on Penalty submitted by the University and the Student. The
   Panel also heard submissions regarding the appropriateness of the
   penalty, reviewed relevant past decisions of the Tribunal submitted by
   the University, and considered the factors set out in University of
   Toronto and Mr. C (Case No. 1976/77-3). With respect to the Student's
   character, the Panel noted that while the Student was not initially
   forthcoming, did not admit to the offence at the outset, and
   subsequently failed to meet with the Dean's office, they did attend the
   hearing and took the opportunity to express remorse for their conduct.
   The Panel further considered that the Student had no prior offences and
   that there were no extenuating circumstances raised by the Student. The
   Panel concluded that the joint submission was reasonable and that the
   recommended sanctions were appropriate.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a five-year suspension from
   the University; a permanent notation on the Student's academic record
   and transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

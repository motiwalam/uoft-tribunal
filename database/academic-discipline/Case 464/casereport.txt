Decision on Penaltv

[2] The following ruling on penalty was issued. orally on April 24, 2008:

The panel accepts the joint submission on penalty. Expulsion is the most serious·
penalty which can be imposed under the Code. However, the offence for which
the student has been convicted is an extremely serious one. Ms. M
submitted two essays in POL 200Y which she had obtained in large part from
internet sources. It is essential that academic work submitted for credit be
original. It is Wlfair to the other students if credit is received fur papers that have
been purchased. It is fundamental to the University's reputation that it show no
tolerance for plagiarism.

The panel therefure imposes the following penalty:
1. A grade of zero shall be assigned in POL 200-Y.

2. We recommend that the President recommend to the Governing Council that
Ms. M-■■lbe expelled from the University.
should be

3. Pending the decision of the Goveming Council, Ms. M
suspended from the University for a period up to five years.

4. This decision should be reported to fue Provost who may publish a notice of
this decision and the sanctions imposed with Ms. M

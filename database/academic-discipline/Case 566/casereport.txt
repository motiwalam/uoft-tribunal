REASONS FOR DECISION
Background

1.

A hearing was held with respect to this matter on February 10, 2010.

2.

In view of the Agreed Statement of Facts (a copy of which is attached to this
Decision), the admissions of the student and the representations of counsel, the
Tribunal was unanimously of the view that the student had violated Section B.1.3
(b) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 ("the Code") in that he
knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct,
fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain
academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind.

Essentially, the

student, in order to avoid the consequences of handing in a term project in a
course late (or not at all) had, after already being granted one extension,
improperly gained access to a University office (by means of a security access
card that was available to him because of his temporary employment by the
University in an unrelated capacity) and left there a broken, unreadable computer
disc and other documents attempting to suggest that the project had in fact been
completed and handed in in a timely manner.
3.

Further, on the basis of a further agreed upon statement of facts and a joint
agreed upon submission to penalty (a copy of which is also attached to this
Decision), and after hearing from the student himself as well as counsel, the
Tribunal unanimously accepted the agreed upon penalty:
(a)

the student shall receive a final grade of zero in the course HSC 302H5
Biocommunication Visualization;

(b)

the student shall be suspended from the University from April 30, 2010
until April 30, 2013;

(c)

the sanction shall be recorded on the student's academic record and
transcript from the date the Tribunal renders its decision until April 30,
2013;

(d)

4.

that this case shali be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of
the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed in the University
newspapers. with the name cf the student withheld.

The Tr:buna! then unanimousiy made the appropriate orders.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO

IN THE MATTER OF charges of academic dishonesty made on November 18, 2009,

AND IN THE MATTER OF the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters, 1995,

For the purposes of this hearing under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters

("Code"), the Provost of the University of Toronto (the "Provost") and

!II

("Mr.

("JBD"). The Provost and Mr. J - agree that:
(a)

each document contained in the JBD may be admitted into evidence before the
Tribunal for all purposes, including for the truth of the document's contents,
without further need to prove the document; and

(b)

if a document indicates that it was sent or received by someone, that is prima

facie proof that the document was sent and received as indicated.

2.

This hearing arises out of a charge of academic misconduct made by the Provost under

the Code. A copy of the charge, which was filed on November 18, 2009, is included in the JBD
at Tab 1 ("Charge").

5.

Mr.

J-

first registered as a student at the University of Toronto at Mississauga in Fall

2004. At all material times, Mr. J - remained a student at the University. In 2009, Mr. J was enrolled in the course of study leading to a major in Communication, Culture & Information
Technology program ("CCIT'). A copy of Mr. Jllll's academic record dated February 2, 2010,
is included in the JBD at Tab 3.

A.

The Assignment

6.

In Winter 2009, Mr. J - enrolled in HSC 302H5 - Biocommunication Visualization,

which was taught by Professor David Mazierski and Professor Shelley Wall ("Course"). A copy
of the syllabus and schedule for the Course is included in the JBD at Tab 4. Mr. J - admits
that he received a copy of the syllabus for the Course.

7.

Assignment #3 in the Course was a three-part assignment described as a "Didactic

conceptual illustration, rationale paper, and presentation" ("Assignment"). The Assignment was

on the basis that he had been ill the week before. Dr. Wall provided him with an extension until
April 13, 2009, but Mr. J - did not hand in the Assignment on that date. On April 14, 2009,

747192-2

provided audio/visual services to classrooms at the University of Toronto Mississauga. To
provide these services, the Classroom Technology Department had swipe cards that granted
access to most classrooms and offices on campus. Mr. J - admits that he had access to
these swipe cards solely because of his part-time employment in the Classroom Technology
Department.
12.

On May 6, 2009, Mr. J - surreptitiously obtained a room key to room SE2005 from the

desk of one of his co-workers. He used that key to gain access to SE2005 and to remove swipe
cards, which he believed would give him access to CC3029, which housed the mailroom for the
CCIT program.
13.

On May 6, 2009, at 2:30 a.m., Mr. J - used the swipe cards he had obtained to try _

and open the door to CC3029. The first two attempts to open the door using one swipe card
were unsuccessful. Mr. J-'s third try, using a different card, was successful, and he obtained
unauthorized access to CC3029 at 2:35 a.m.

C.

The package

14.

On May 7, 2009, Mr. J - created and assembled several items that purportedly

related to the Assignment (the "Package"). The Package consisted of:
(a)

a letter from Mr. J - t o Ms Rose Antonio, which was dated April 15, 2009, and
which read, in part, "I have been asked by Professor Shelley Waif to submit my
assignment for HSC302 to you for collection. Kindly find the attached envelope
and let her know you have received it" ("Cover Letter");

747192-2

4

(b)

a blue Post-It note that was stuck to the cover letter, on which was written "For
Rose, Net one of m;ne" and en which appears an illegible signature ("Post-It");

(c)

a padded envelope, on which was written: 'To Prof. Shelley Wall, HSC302"
("Padded Envelope"); and

(d)

a broken CD, which was placed within the padded envelope ("Broken CD").

15.

Photocopies of the Package are included in the JBD at Tab 7.

D.

May 7 - the second unauthorized entry into room CC3029

16.

On May 7, 2009, at 3:45 a.m., Mr. J - used the swipe card to gain access to CC3029.

17.

He entered the room, without authorization, and placed the Package in the mailbox of

Rose Antonio, Undergraduate Counsellor for the CCIT program.

18.

Ms. Antonio discovered the Package when she arrived for work on May 7.

E.

Admissions

19.

In addition to the admissions set out above, Mr. J - admits that to mislead the

University in order to obtain, or attempt to obtain an academic advantage, he knowingly:

(a)

dated the Cover Letter April 15 to make it look like he had submitted the Package
and the Assignment more or less on time;

(b)

added the Post-It to make it look as if he had submitted the Assignment more or
less on time, but it had then become lost somewhere in the CC!T office.

(c)

included the Broken CD to make it appear as if he had completed the
Assignment, but on media that would not be machine readable.

20.

Mr. J - admits that he never completed the Assignment and he engaged in the

conduct described above in an attempt to obtain more time to complete the Assignment and to
reduce or avoid a penalty for submitting the Assignment after its due date.
747192-2

Mr.

JJ-

5

admits that he knowingiy engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty

or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain
academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in connection with the Assignment,
contrary to section 8.l.3(b) of the Code.

22.

Mr.

acknowledges that the Provost has advised him to obtain independent legal

advice before signing this ASF. He acknowledges that he is signing this ASF freely and
voluntarily, knowing of the potential consequences he faces, and with the benefit of the advice
of counsel.

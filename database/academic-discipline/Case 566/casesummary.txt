   Student charged under s. B.1.3(b) of the Code. The Student plead guilty
   to the charge that he, in order to avoid the consequences of handing in
   a term project late, after already being granted one extension,
   improperly gained access to a University office and left there a
   broken, unreadable computer disc and other documents attempting to
   suggest the project had in fact been completed and handed in a timely
   manner. The matter proceeded on an Agreed Statement of Facts and a
   Joint Submission on Penalty. The Panel unanimously accepted the agreed
   upon penalty. The Panel imposed a grade of zero in the course, a
   three-year suspension, a two month and three-year notation on the
   studentâs academic record and transcript, and that a report be issued
   to the Provost.

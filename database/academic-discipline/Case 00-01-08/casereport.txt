Dear Mr. C.:
At its hearing held on October 10, 2000, the Trial Division of the University Tribunal considered
the following charge against you:
1. That on or about August 12, 1997 you knowingly personated another person
at an academic examination contrary to section B.1.1. (c) of the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters.
The particulars of the charges are as follows:
1.

On August 12, 1997, the final examination for ECO 200Y (97S) was held.

2.

You attended at that examination and presented yourself as Mr. P.1, student
number 940451000.

3.

You wrote the final examination for ECO 200Y in Mr. P.’s name and under his
student number.

-

I am writing to formally confirm that the panel found you guilty of the charge. The Panel
provided the following reasons for this decision:

1

See 2000/01-07

-2With respect to Mr. C. we do not find any extenuating circumstances at all. There
is no evidence that there was any. In fact, some of the evidence appears to be
with the difficulty in locating Mr. C. and this may be contributing to the delay and
having these matters brought to trial. As a result we recommend to the President
of the University the expulsion of Mr. C. and that there be publication with his
name withheld.
Information concerning rights of appeal may be found in Section E. of the Code of Behaviour on
Academic Matters. The deadline for filing an appeal is December 8, 2000.
Yours sincerely,
“Margaret McKone”
Ms Margaret McKone
Acting Secretary

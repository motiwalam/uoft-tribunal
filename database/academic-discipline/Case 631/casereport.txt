(5)

Ms. K
submitted her Long Assignment I in partial completion of the Course
requirements ("Assignment").

(6)

Professor Heller graded the Assignment and noted that it was virtually identical to
an assignment submitted by another student K.K.

(7)

In particular, Professor Heller noted that it was highly unusual for two students to
report the exact same measures or to use the same text to explain the results, as the
assignment was worded very generally and did not tell the students which
measurement to use or which graph to draw.

(8)

Ms. K

(9)

admits that with respect to the Assignment she knowingly:

(a)

copied the work of K,K, without authorization or attribution, and in doing so

person, and the work of another person as her own;

(b)

committed plagiarism contrary to section B.I.l(d) of the Code; and

(c)

engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit, contrary to section

LIN305.

( 11) The academic requirements for LIN306 included three assignments. The second of

these assignments was due February 16, 201 l, and was worth 20% of the comse
mark. The Professor distributed a description of this assignment to the class. It

discussion, use of examples to support your discussion, quality of sources and
proper citation,,,"
( 12) Ms. K
submitted Assignment 2 in partial completion of the Course requirements
("Assignment 2"),

Decision of the Tl'ihunal
[61

On the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts and the Joint Book of Documents, the
Tribunal accepted the plea and found a contravention of the Code as set out in the
Charges 1 and 4. At this time, the Provost indicated its intention not to proceed with
Charges 2, 3 and 5 and these were withdrawn.

Sanction Phase

[7]

[8]

The parties entered an Agreed Statement of Facts on Sanction, which was marked as
Exhibit 4, and which included the following facts:
(a)

In June 2008 Ms. K
was found to be in possession of an unauthorized aid in
the form of notes relevant to the course inside a pencil case on her desk during a
final exam in UN203H 1. The notes were written in very small lct1crs.

(b)

Ms. K
met with the Dean's Designate in August, 2008, at which time she
claimed not to know that she couldn't have the aid in the pencil case on her desk.
After discussion, she admitted that she had the notes in her possession and thereby
committed an academic offence.

(c)

The Dean's Designate imposed a sanction of a zero for the exam and a notation
on her transcript that she had committed an academic offence.

(d)

The Dean's Designate also stated in a letter to Ms. K
in which he informed her
of the sanction that: "Academic offences constitute unacceptable behaviour in the
University. This letter is to serve as a warning to you that any foture academic
work must be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
University ... , While I hope you have learned from this experience, I must warn
you that any further offence will be treated more severely,"

(e)

Ms. K
is cunently serving an academic suspension of 1 year which
commenced at the end of the Winter 2011 term and will end al the end of the
Winter 2012 term.

(J)

Ms. K
acknowledges that she needs to take steps to address her limited writing
experience and skills, and additionally to be fully aware of her obligations as a
student of the University.

The parties also provided to the Tribunal an unde11aking executed by Ms K
was marked as Exhibit 5, The Undertaking provides in material part as follows:

. 6.

, which

(a)

Ms. K
undertakes to complete the workshops described below through the
University of Toronto St. George Camp11s College Writing Centres Academic
Skills Workshops ("Undertaking").

(b)

Ms. K
will fulfill the Undei-taking by taking the following 6 workshops, which
amount to 6 homs of instruction:
l.
2
3.
4.
5.
6.

Understanding the Assignment
Library Research
Thesis Statements
Organizing an Essay
Using Sources
Revising the Essay

( c)

Ms. K
agrees to complete the workshops in the term in which she is next
registered for a course at the University.

( d)

In the event that these workshops are not available at the time Ms. K
attempts
to complete them, the University will, acting reasonably, propose an alternate and
equivalent program that Ms. K
shall complete to fulfill the Undertaking.

(e)

Ms. K
acknowledges that the Provost of the University of Toronto intends to
seek a sanction which includes a 3 year suspension and a 4 year notation before
the University Tribunal. Ms. K
fm1her acknowledges that the Provost takes
this position, in part, in reliance on Ms. K
's Unde11aking, and, without it, the
Provost would not seek a sanction before the University Tribunal that included a
suspension of only 3 years and a notation of only 4 years.

(f)

Ms. K
agrees and accepts that she will not be eligible to graduate from the
University until she fulfills the Undertaking and the University may rely on this
Undertaking to deny her the ability to graduate until it is fulfilled.

[9]

In addition, Ms K
actions.

[10]

The pat1ies submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty, in which the following sanctions
were jointly proposed:
(a)

made a statement to the Tribunal that she was very sorry for her

a final grade of zero in each of the following courses:

. 7.

(b)

(i)

LIN 305; and

(ii)

LIN 306.

a suspension from the University to commence May I, 2012, and to end April 30,
2015;

(c)

a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript from the date of
the Order until the earlier of her graduation from the University or April 30, 20 l 6,

[ 11]

The parties also proposed that the Panel order that this case be reported to the Provost for
publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed in the
University newspapers, with the name of the student withheld.

[12]

The parties agreed that the suspension would be consecutive to the student's current
academic suspension, and therefore, as indicated in the joint submission, would
commence on May I, 2012,

[13]

The Panel was provided with a number of cases in support of the joint submission. Two
of these cases included undertakings as an element of the sanction, a relatively new and
infrequently used tool in these cases,

[ 14]

Discipline Counsel reminded the Panel that there is a high threshold for refusing to accept
a joint submission, and that the Panel would have to be of the view that the
administration of justice was brought into disrepute by the acceptance of that joint
submission in order to depart from it.

Sanction

[15]

In the circumstances, the Panel is of the view that the joint submission is within the
appropriate range of penalty in this case, and accepts the submission,

(16]

The Panel would, however, like to stress that while an undertaking can be a very useful
tool in penalty and rehabilitation, and the parties are to be commended for working
together toward rehabilitation and remediation, the use and contents of the undertaking
should not be viewed as an excuse for the behaviour set out in the Agreed Statement of
Facts, If students do not have the requisite knowledge and skill to comply with basic
requirements of academic life at the University, it is preferable that these deficiencies be
addressed before, and not as a result 01: repeated academic offences, Nonetheless, as
stated, the Panel accepts and agrees that the student's willingness to work with the
University toward rehabilitation and remediation is a mitigating factor in considering the
appropriate sanction.

[ 17]

Therefore, the Panel orders:

-8-

I) that ivls. K
is guilty of guilty of two charges of the academic offence of plagiarism
contrary to section B.l(l)(d) of the Code o/13ehavio11r 011 Ac11de111ic Mallers;
2) that 1vls. K

received a linal grade oi'zero in the course L1N3051-l1;

3) that /vis K

receive a final grade of zero in the course L1N306I-J 1;

4) that Ms K
be suspended from the University !'or three years, to commence on May
I, 2012, and to end April 30, 2015;
5) that the sanction shall be rccorclec! on her academic record and transcript from the
date of the Order until April 30, 2016, or the date of her graduation from the
University, whichever is earlier; and
6) that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the name of the student
withheld.

   Student charged with 4 offences under s. B.i.1(d) and s. B.i.3(b) of
   the Code . The charges related to laboratory assignments, one in
   chemistry and one in biology, that were submitted in partial completion
   of course requirements.Â  The laboratory assignments were handed in two
   days apart.Â  They contained unattributed ideas, the expression of
   ideas, and verbatim or nearly verbatim text from a website that the
   student represented as her own ideas.

   The Student participated in both the Dean's Designate meeting and the
   Tribunal hearing. The Student admitted to copying portions of the
   assignment from the Internet, but denied wrongdoing. The Panel found
   the Student ought reasonably to have known that her conduct was
   unacceptable and constituted an academic offence.Â Â  The Panel also
   rejected the Student's suggestion that, because the assignment in one
   course involved submitting a mere "draft" and not the final report,
   submitting work that was not her own, was acceptable. Upon finding the
   Student guilty of plagiarism, the University withdrew the academic
   dishonesty charges.

   In sanctioning the Student, the Panel acknowledged that the Student did
   not have a prior discipline history. The Panel emphasized that whether
   or not a student has participated in a prior academic discipline
   process is but one factor among many that must be weighed in the
   sanctioning process. That a student has not engaged previously in a
   discipline process is not a mitigating factor. Rather, where a student
   is found guilty of an academic infraction that was committed after the
   student participated in an academic discipline process, the Panel will
   consider this as a factor that may warrant a more serious sanction
   since the student's prospects for rehabilitation are diminished.

   Here, the charges related to two infractions that occurred days apart,
   but prior to any meeting with the Deanâs Designate or engagement with
   the academic discipline process. The Panel accepted that in situations
   like this, the University distinguishes between a student who commits a
   second offence after the imposition of an academic discipline process
   that results in a finding of guilt, and a student who commits multiple
   infractions prior to the imposition of a first academic discipline
   process.

   In the former situation, the University can legitimately assert that
   the student committed the second offence despite involvement in the
   University's discipline process. These circumstances reflect poorly on
   the student's ability or willingness to have gained insight from the
   discipline process. In the latter situation, however, the University
   would not be able to assert that the student ought to have gained
   insight from the academic discipline process. Depending on the facts,
   particularly where the infractions occurred within a relatively short
   period, multiple infractions may be bundled up in one offence or be
   considered two or more offences that occurred within a short spate of
   time.

   The Panel did not accept University Counselâs submission on a penalty
   of three yearsâ suspension, distinguishing the Studentâs case from
   precedent where three yearsâ suspension was found to be an appropriate
   penalty.Â  Here the student committed two distinct infractions prior to
   any involvement with the discipline process so the Studentâs ability to
   learn from her misconduct was limited by the close succession of the
   offences. The Student had no prior record of academic dishonesty.
   Finally, she attended the Deanâs Designate meeting and the Tribunal
   hearing.Â  She denied wrongdoing throughout so it could not be said
   that she âcooperatedâ in the discipline process, but the Panel found
   that it would be incorrect to treat the Student akin to students who
   partially or wholly avoid the discipline process altogether.

   The Panel imposed a final grade of zero in two courses; suspension from
   the University for two years; the sanction be recorded on the Studentâs
   academic record and transcript for three years; and reporting to the
   Provost.

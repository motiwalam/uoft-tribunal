   The Student

   Theâ¯Studentâ¯was charged underâ¯ss. B.i.1(d),
   B.i.1(f),Â andÂ B.i.1(a)â¯of theâ¯Code of Behaviour on Academic
   Matters, 1995â¯(theÂ âCodeâ) on the basis thatÂ heÂ (a)Â on
   twoÂ occasions, knowinglyÂ represented the ideas of another, or the
   expressions of the ideas of another, asÂ hisÂ own work
   inÂ twoÂ assignments;Â (b)Â on three occasions, knowinglyÂ forged or in
   any other way altered or falsifiedÂ a document or evidence required by
   the UniversityÂ in reference to three Verification of Student Illness
   or Injury FormsÂ (âVOIâ);Â andÂ (c)Â on one occasion,
   knowinglyÂ submitted academic work containing a purportedÂ statement of
   fact or reference to aÂ sourceÂ which has beenÂ concoctedÂ in an
   assignment he submitted for a course.Â In the alternative,
   theâ¯Studentâ¯was charged under s.â¯B.i.3(b) of theâ¯Codeâ¯on the basis
   that theâ¯Studentâ¯knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct,Â fraudÂ or misrepresentationâ¯in order
   toâ¯obtain academic credit or other academic advantageâ¯inÂ various
   courses and assignments.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of
   theâ¯Studentâ¯appeared at the hearing.â¯The PanelÂ waited fifteen
   minutesÂ after the hearing was scheduled to commenceÂ but the Student
   did not appear.â¯Rule 9 of theâ¯University TribunalâsÂ RulesÂ of
   Practice and ProcedureÂ (âRulesâ)â¯providesÂ thatâ¯service can
   beâ¯effectedâ¯viaâ¯email to the studentâs email address in ROSI.â¯The
   Panel noted that students are responsible for maintaining a current and
   valid mailingÂ address and University-issued email account on ROSI and
   are expected toÂ retrieve mail and email on a frequent and consistent
   basis.Â The University provided evidence that theâ¯Studentâ¯had been
   served at his ROSI-listed email address with theâ¯charges,Â a
   disclosure brief,â¯andÂ theÂ notice ofÂ electronicÂ hearing.â¯Counsel
   for the University provided further evidence that their office
   attempted to contact the StudentÂ viaÂ the ROSI email,Â LinkedInÂ and
   telephoneÂ to discuss the matter and hearing datesÂ with the
   Student.Â The Panel also received evidence that the Student had last
   accessed his University emailÂ the day after the notice of electronic
   hearing was delivered.â¯The Panel found that reasonable notice of the
   hearing had been provided to the Student in accordance with theÂ rule 9
   and 17 of theÂ Rules andÂ ss. 6 and 7
   ofÂ theÂ StatutoryÂ PowersÂ ProcedureÂ Act, therefore the Panel ordered
   that the hearingÂ proceed in theâ¯Studentâsâ¯absence.

   Regarding the charges laid under ss.â¯B.i.1(d),Â B.i.1(f),Â and
   B.i.1(a)â¯of theâ¯Code, theâ¯Panel examined the evidenceÂ ofÂ theÂ two
   ProfessorsÂ who taughtâ¯the coursesÂ for which the assignmentsÂ in
   question wereÂ submittedÂ as well as the Associate Registrar for the
   University of Toronto Mississauga campus.â¯The
   PanelÂ receivedÂ evidenceÂ from the ProfessorsÂ that the StudentÂ was
   required toÂ submit hisÂ assignmentsÂ via Turnitin.com.
   TheÂ TurnitinÂ OriginalityÂ ReportÂ for the assignment submitted
   forÂ POL208Y5YÂ had aÂ 57% similarity index to other sources in the
   Turnitin database.Â The Professor explained that theÂ Student quoted
   verbatim from secondary sources but did not use quotation
   marks,Â copiedÂ text from secondaryÂ sourcesÂ near verbatim, and
   included a quotation on the assignment that was purported to be from
   the Professorâs slideshow but in fact,Â it didÂ notÂ appear in the
   slideshow.Â The ProfessorÂ also noted thatÂ the Student had cited
   source material in some of theÂ footnotes,Â but those citations were
   different than other material that the ProfessorÂ had identified as the
   likely source of the content.Â The Professor for POL200Y5YÂ noted
   thatÂ Turnitin is an instrument for detecting plagiarism and is used as
   an initial screen only.Â The Professor provided evidence that when the
   TurnitinÂ originality reportÂ returnsÂ a high similarity index, she
   reviews the citationsÂ herself. She testified that in this case
   sheÂ discovered that threeÂ lines of the assignment that were identical
   to the first lines of an online essayÂ which the Student did not
   paraphrase or citeÂ inÂ theirÂ essay.

   The Associate RegistrarÂ provided evidenceÂ that the Student submitted
   sixÂ petitions/VOIâs to defer four final exams.Â Two of the VOIs
   submittedÂ were acceptedÂ by the UniversityÂ which allowed the deferral
   of two exams. Three additional VOIs were submittedÂ by the Student as
   supporting documentation for the conditional deferrals granted to the
   Student.Â Upon investigation, the UniversityÂ determined thatÂ the
   registration number for the doctor did not match the doctorâs name nor
   did the hospital have any records of the Student attending that
   hospital.Â The Associate RegistrarÂ provided evidence that the Student
   admitted to theÂ academic offences with reference to the two
   assignmentsÂ submitted by the Student. However, the Student
   deniedÂ that he submitted the invalid VOIs to the Office of the
   Registrar and that the only VOIs he submitted were the two that the
   University accepted.Â OnÂ the evidenceâ¯presented by the
   University,â¯theâ¯Panel found thatâ¯on the balance of
   probabilitiesâ¯theâ¯Studentâ¯was guilty ofâ¯two countsÂ ofÂ knowingly
   representing the idea of another, or the expressions of the ideas of
   another,Â contrary to section B.i.1(d)Â ofÂ the CodeÂ butÂ the Panel
   found that the University did not prove, on a balance of probabilities,
   that the StudentÂ concoctedÂ a source referenced inÂ theÂ assignment,
   contrary to B.i.1(f) of the Code. The Panel noted thatÂ for an
   allegation of concoction toÂ beÂ proven on a balance of probabilities,
   the University needs to demonstrate that the source that was cited
   could not be validatedÂ and, in thisÂ case,Â the Panel found that
   without such confirmation or validation, the University had not
   established this allegation.Â With respect to the remaining
   allegationsÂ under s. B.i.1(a) of the Code, the Panel found that the
   totality of the evidenceÂ supportsÂ a finding of guilt, namely that the
   Student made use of forged,Â alteredÂ or falsified documents in support
   ofÂ exam deferralÂ requests.Â Given the Panelâs finding, the University
   withdrew the charge underâ¯s.â¯B.i.3(b).

   In determining sanction,â¯theâ¯Panel considered the principles and
   factors relevant to sanctionâ¯discussed inâ¯University of Toronto and
   Mr. C.â¯(âMr. C. factorsâ)â¯and determined thatâ¯it was important to
   consider theÂ veryÂ seriousÂ and deliberateÂ nature of the offence, the
   detriment to the University and theÂ need toÂ deter others from
   committing similar offences.â¯The Panel noted that this offence
   isÂ veryÂ seriousÂ and deliberateÂ in nature. The University must be
   able to trust that its students are submitting legitimate
   documentationÂ in support of an accommodationÂ or late withdrawal
   requestsÂ and when this trust is abused,Â they risk the ability of
   other students to obtain the same type of accommodationÂ or
   request.Â The Panel further noted that general deterrence is an
   important factor in these casesÂ and given the number of relevant
   cases, the misuse and falsification of VOIs is an ongoing issue at the
   University for which there must be deterrence.Â It also recognizes that
   plagiarism strikes at the heart of academic integrityÂ and,
   accordingly, the Panel found that it is appropriate to send a strong
   message to students that this type of misconduct will be treated very
   seriously.Â Upon review of the relevant case law and the Mr. C.
   factors, the Panelâ¯found that theÂ sanction proposed by the
   UniversityÂ was appropriate.â¯Theâ¯Panelâ¯imposedâ¯the following
   sanctions:â¯a final grade of zero in the courses;â¯aâ¯four-year
   suspension;â¯aâ¯five-year notation on the transcript; andâ¯aâ¯report to
   the Provost forÂ publication.

   Ms. Michelle Henry, Observer, newly-appointed Tribunal Co-Chair (August
   25, 2016)
   The Student was charged with 13 counts of misconduct under sections
   B.i.1(a) , B.i.1(b) , and B.i.1(d) of the Code , or in the alternative,
   s . B.i.3(b) of the Code . Â The Parties produced an Agreed Statement
   of Facts (ASF) and entered into a plea agreement. The Student pled
   guilty to two charges of making false statements in documents seeking
   academic accommodation contrary to s. B.i.1(a) of the Code and six
   charges of plagiarism contrary to s. B.i.1(d) of the Code . The
   plagiarism charges related to work that was submitted for course credit
   in four different courses that was either purchased from a commercial
   provider of essays, copied from lecture slides, an on-line forum,
   assigned course readings, or from academic articles. The Panel found
   the Student guilty of these eight charges. The University withdrew the
   other charges.
   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel applied the
   principles set out in University of Toronto v. Mr. C (Case No.
   1976/77-3; November 5, 1976): (a) the character of the person charged;
   (b) the likelihood of a repetition of the offence; (c) the nature of
   the offence committed; (d) any extenuating circumstances surrounding
   the commission of the offence; (e) the detriment to the University
   occasioned by the offence; and (f) the need to deter others from
   committing a similar offence.
   The Student had previously been sanctioned for two separate incidents
   of plagiarism. The Panel found this history, combined with the large
   number of incidents of misconduct at issue, the fact that these
   incidents were committed shortly after the Student had already been
   warned and disciplined for prior offences, and that they were committed
   while the Student was under a transcript notation for the prior
   offences, were strong factors which indicated that there is a
   significant likelihood that the Student was likely to repeat the
   offences. Â In addition, the Panel found that the Student had failed to
   take responsibility for his actions. Further, the Panel found that the
   Studentâs conduct at the hearing constituted an aggravating factor for
   the purpose of sanctioning. The Studentâs lateness, lack of
   preparation, and inflammatory accusations against counsel and the Panel
   demonstrated a lack of respect for the University and its discipline
   process and raised serious concerns about the Student's continued
   inability to govern himself in accordance with the University's
   standards, rules and responsibilities.
   The Panel found that the offences of plagiarism and filing a false
   petition were very serious acts of misconduct that occasioned detriment
   to the University and required a strong need to deter others. Â The
   Panel referred to the Discipline Appeal Board decision, University of
   Toronto v C., H. and K. (Case No. 596, 597, 598, November 23, 2011)
   which held that purchasing an essay is generally sanctioned by an
   expulsion because it involves intention, planning and deliberate
   deception, a 3rd party commercial element, and is often more difficult
   than other types of plagiarism to detect. The Panel found that
   falsification of information in a petition was a very serious offence
   because it took advantage of the University's petition system which is
   intended to provide students who experience genuine personal
   difficulties or circumstances with a means to obtain extraordinary
   relief from academic requirements and deadlines. By submitting false
   information in his personal statements, the Student breached his
   relationship of trust with the University and undermined the integrity
   of the petition system.
   The Student argued that the Panel could not consider the facts in the
   ASF where he had admitted to purchasing an essay because those
   admissions related to the unauthorized assistance charge, which was
   subsequently withdrawn by the University when the Student pled guilty
   to the plagiarism charge that related to the same incident. Â  The
   Panel held that the withdrawal of a charge by the University does not
   have the effect of preventing the Tribunal from taking into account
   facts admitted in the ASF that relate to the withdrawn charge. The
   facts concerning the unauthorized assistance charge related to and
   supported the charge of plagiarism to which the Student pled guilty.
   Furthermore, the Panel found that the argument that "plagiarism" is a
   different charge than "purchasing an essay" was also not consistent
   with Tribunal jurisprudence, which commonly considers purchased essays
   as a form of "plagiarism" under the Code .
   The Panel did not find that the Studentâs mental health and learning
   disabilities to be mitigating factors in the circumstances because the
   evidence failed to establish that these disabilities had any temporal
   or causal link to or were a justification, explanation or excuse for
   the commission by the Student of the offences. Â The Student was
   sanctioned with a grade of zero in each of the affected courses; an
   order that the Student be immediately suspended from the University for
   up to 5 years pending an order of expulsion; and an order that the case
   be reported to the Provost for publication with the Student's name
   withheld.

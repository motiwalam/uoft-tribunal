1. The particulars of the offences as set out in the Charges were as follows:
a. At all material times the Student was registered at the University of
Toronto Mississauga.
b. In Fall 2014 the Student enrolled in the Course, which was taught by
Professor Vincent Robinson.
c. The Student knowingly submitted the Assignment, which was worth 8% of
the Course mark, for credit on October 20, 2014.
d. In performing the Assignment the Student knew that he was required to
use the Geography Department’s computer system, and in particular
GRASS GIS software.
e. The Student knowingly did not access the computing system, and in
particular did not use the GRASS GIS to perform the Assignment.
f. The Student knowingly did not do any of the required computer work for
the Assignment, but constructed the answers using information obtained
from a former student or students in the Course.
g. For the purposes of obtaining academic credit and/or other academic
advantage, the Student knowingly obtained unauthorized assistance in the
Assignment .

2. Based on the Statement of Agreed Facts, Appendix 1, the Panel unanimously
found the Student guilty on the following charge:

On or about October 20, 2014, the Student knowingly used or possessed an unauthorized aid or
aids or obtained unauthorized assistance in connection with Assignment 2 in GGR372H5F
(“Assignment” and “Course” respectively), contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code.

3

3. The University and the Student presented an Agreed Statement of Facts on
Sanction, which is attached to these Reasons as Appendix 2 as well as a Joint
Submission On Penalty, which is attached to these Reasons as Appendix 3.
4. The factors that need to be considered in determining penalty have been

-

repeated very often and have been established for many years and one
reference is in paragraph 31 of Tab 1 of Book of Authorities, in the T
794) case:
(a)

the character of the person charged;

(b)

the likelihood of a repetition of the offence;

(c)

the nature of the offence committed;

(d)

any extenuating circumstances surrounding the

(Case

commission of the offence;
(e)

the detriment to the University occasioned by the
offence.

(f)

the need to deter others from committing a similar
offence.

(see In the matter of the University of Toronto Code of
Behaviour, an appeal by Mr. C, [Case No. 1976/77-3;
November 5, 1976] page 12.)
5. We have considered all of these factors and have unanimously concluded that
the Joint Submission on Penalty is the appropriate penalty.
6. This is Mr. L

■

’s third offence. Mr. L

■

received fair warning at the time of the

first two offences that he must abide by The Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters. For reasons for which are totally unknown to us, and on which no
evidence was presented, he deliberately failed to comply with the requirements

4

of the course he was taking and instead submitting as his work, the work of
another.
7. The sanction needs to be significant to reflect the seriousness of not only the
offence itself, but the fact that it is a third offence.
8. Ms. Harmer suggested that there was no likelihood of repetition, because Mr.
L

■ is in position to graduate after this offence has been dealt with. We do not
accept this submission. If Mr. L wished to go onto post graduate work, perhaps
■
a Master’s Degree, or beyond that, or into a professional faculty, repetition of the
offence could occur.
9. Mr. L

■ , or any other student, must earn his marks and his degree honourably:

everything that is submitted for course credit must be the student’s own work. In
the career world any student will serve better if he has performed all the tasks
necessary to obtain his degree honestly; a student cannot learn what is needed
for the skill or work that he aims to pursue if he has not done the work himself to
train for that skill or work. While Mr. L

■ has hurt the University in committing this

offence, he has hurt himself more.
10. We are mindful that Mr. L

■

has taken full responsibility for his conduct as soon

as he attended the Dean’s meeting in March of 2015. However for various
reasons, not known to the Panel, the hearing did not take place until a full year
later. A delay of one year from the time the Student admitted guilt, to the time
that the Tribunal was in a position to hear this matter and determine the sanction,
is a relatively long delay.

The Joint Submission provided that Mr. L

■

be

suspended from the University for a period of three years, commencing on
November 1, 2015 and ending on October 31, 2018. If the requirements for not
accepting an Agreed Joint Submission on Penalty were not as stringent as they
were, we might have considered backdating the suspension to March of 2015;
rather than to the Fall of 2015. Mr. L

■ should not be penalized, because it takes

so long to get to the point where the Tribunal can hear the matter and determine
Sanction.

5

11. The Sanction to be imposed in accordance with the Joint Submission is as
follows:
a. THAT Mr. L

■ is guilty of one count of unauthorized aid /

assistance,

contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters;

■ receive a final grade of zero in GGR372H5 in Fall 2014;

b. THAT Mr. L

c. THAT Mr. L

■ be suspended from the University for a period of three

years, commencing on November 1, 2015 and ending on October 31,
2018
d. THAT the sanction be recorded on Mr. L

■ ’s academic record and

transcript to the effect that he was sanctioned for academic misconduct,
for a period of four years from the date of this Order, to March 2, 2020, or
until his graduation from the University, whichever is earlier.
e. THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice
of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed, with
the name of the Student withheld.
All of which was ordered on March 3, 2016

Mr.Hlll•J.11

Thornhill, ON L3T OBS
Dear Mr.

r..l:

In your interview with Professor G. Scott Graham on August 16, 2011, in the presence of Ms Yvette Ye,
departmental undergraduate advisor, you admitted you were guilty of academic misconduct in two courses.
Specifically, you admitted obtaining unauthorized assistance to complete Assignment 1 in the course
CSC 108H5F, 2010 (9) and for having in your possession a cell phone while writing your final examination
in MAT102H5F, 2010 (9). Under section C.I.(a)8 of the University's Code ofBehaviour on Academic
Matters, I therefore impose the following sanctions:

CSC108HSF, 2010, (9):
~

•

a mark of zero (0) for Assignment 1 in the course; and
an annotation on transcript of"Mark reduced in the course
CSCl 08H5F, 2010 (9). due to academic misconduct" for 6 months, from
August 16, 2011 to February 16, 2012.

MAT102H5F, 2010, (9):
•
~

a written reprimand; and
an annotation on transcript of"Cautioned - Possession of an unauthorized aid during the
final examination in the course MAT102H5F, 2010 (9)" for 6 months, from August 16,
201 I to February 16, 2012.

I trust that you have had time to reflect on the seriousness of this incident and will not commit another
academic offence. Please be advised that any subsequent allegations of offence are usually referred directly
to the Tribunal for investigation. I urge you to do everything in your power to make a success of your
academic career at the University of Toronto Mississauga.
Yours sincerely,

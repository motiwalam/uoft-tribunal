PART 2 -AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PLEA
3.

At the outset of the hearing, Discipline Counsel advised that the University and

the Student had entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts. The Agreed Statement of
Facts is attached hereto as Appendix "A".
4.

Pursuant to the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student pied guilty to Charges 1

to 3 listed above. Discipline Counsel advised that if the Tribunal accepted the plea on
Charge 1, then it would withdraw Charge 2.

-35.

The Student admitted that he knowingly submitted a falsified medical note for the

purposes of obtaining an academic accommodation in the form of a deferred exam. The
Student also admitted that he enrolled in courses for academic credit while he was
suspended.
6.

The Student was in attendance with the assistance of student counsel from DLS

and confirmed that he pied guilty to the charges as provided in the Agreed Statement of
Facts.
7.

The details of the charges are set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts and are

supported by documents contained in the Joint Book of Documents. The essential
elements of the charges are set out below.
PART 3 -THE FACTS UNDERLYING THE CHARGES

8.

At all material times the Student was registered at the University of Toronto,

Mississauga.
9.

In the Fall of 2015, the Student was enrolled in GGR353H5F which held the final

examination worth 35 percent of the course mark on December 7, 2015. The Student
did not attend that final examination on December 7, 2015. On December 8. 2015, the
Student submitted a petition in which he sought permission to write a deferred final
exam in GGR353H5F as an academic accommodation indicating that illness prevented
him from writing the examination on December 7, 2015.
10.

On December 11, 2015, in support of his petition, the Student provided a

Verification of Student Illness or Incapacity Form (the "Medical Form") from Dr. P.

-4Stevanoski. The Medical Form was dated December 9, 2015. On the Medical Form, Dr.
Stevanoski indicated that the Student's medical incapacity started on December 8,
2015. The student subsequently wrote the number 7 on top of the number 8 on the start
date of the Medical Form without Dr. Stevanoski's knowledge or consent.
11.

The Student falsified the Medical Form by changing the start date from

December 8 to December 7 to make it appear that the Medical Form covered the
December 7, 2015 date of the final examination in GGR353H5F when it did not in fact
do so. The Student submitted the Medic.al Form knowing it contained false information
in order to obtain an academic accommodation in the form of the deferred exam.
12.

On January 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, the Student was suspended from the

University, having been found guilty of academic misconduct in a course in which he
was enrolled in the Winter 2015 term.
13.

Despite being aware that he was not entitled to enroll in courses during the

period of suspension, the Student enrolled in seven courses in January 2016 as follows:
(i)

RLG204H5S from January 4 to February 29, 2016;

(ii)

ENG205H5S from January 4 to January 12, 2016;

(iii)

GGR217H5S from January 6 to February 29, 2016;

(iv)

GGR252H5S from January 6 to January 17, 2016;

(v)

GGR214H5S from January 7 to January 17, 2016;

(vi)

PSY362H5S from January 12 to February 29, 2016; and,

(vii)
14.

PSY220H5S from January 17 to February 3, 2016.

The Student sought and obtained academic credit for work completed in each of

RLG204H5S, GGR217H5S, and PSY362H5S while he was suspended from the
University.
15.

The University provided an activity log for the Student log-in on the ROSI

System, which showed that he dropped these final three courses only after the
University had contacted him to discuss the matter.
PART 4- DECISION ON CHARGES

16.

The Tribunal reviewed the Agreed Statement of Facts, the documents in support

thereof, and considered the submissions of Discipline Counsel. After deliberations, the
Tribunal determined that the evidence proved Charges 1 and 3 and accepted the guilty
plea entered by the Student.
17.

As a result, the University withdrew Charge 2. The Tribunal makes no findings or

determinations with respect to this charge.
PART 5 - PENALTY

18.

The University and the Student provided an Agreed Statement of Facts on

Sanction and a Joint Submission on Penalty. The document is attached hereto as
Appendix "B".

19.

The joint submission on penalty was as follows:
(a)

a final grade of zero in each of:

-6-

(b)

(i)

GGR353H5F (Fall 2015);

(ii)

RLG204H5S (Winter 2016);

(iii)

GGR217H5S (Winter 2016); and,

(iv)

PSY362H5S (Winter 2016);

immediate suspension from the University commencing on the day the
Tribunal makes its order for a period of five years, from June 16, 2017 to
June 15, 2022; and,

(c)

a notation of the sanction on his academic record and transcript from the
date the Tribunal makes its order until Mr. ~ graduates from the
University.

20.

The parties agree the case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a

notice of the Decision of the Tribunal and the sanction reported in the University
newspapers, with the name of the Student withheld.
21 .

The Agreed Statement of Facts on Sanction provided that the Student had been

sanctioned for two prior academic offences.
22.

On the first offence, the Student admitted to submitting work for academic credit

that contained passages copied from another student. The matter was resolved at the
Department Level.
23.

On September 17, 2015, the Student admitted to possessing notes relating to a

course during the writing of a final exam worth 46 percent of the final grade. He pleaded

-7guilty to the charge of using or possessing an unauthorized aid with a resolution being a
final grade of zero, a suspension from the University for eight months starting January
1, 2016 and an annotation on his transcript for 24 months from September 17, 2015 to
September 16, 2017.
24.

In both of these offences, the Student was cautioned not to commit another

academic offence. In relation to the second offence, he was advised that subsequent
allegations of academic misconduct will usually be referred to the Tribunal.
PART 6 - SUBMISSIONS ON PENALTY

25.

Discipline Counsel provided a Book of Authorities supporting the joint submission

on penalty. She noted that a joint submission on penalty must generally be accepted by
a panel provided it will not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
26.

Discipline Counsel referred to several cases in which a five year suspension was

imposed and submitted that it was a very serious penalty, in that it was often difficult for
a student to re-enroll. She submitted that given the serious nature of the offences and
the Student's previous history, this was an appropriate result.
27.

Ms. Ryu also submitted that this was an appropriate penalty. She submitted that

unlike the cases involving plagiarism, the Student's grades were still of his own work,
even if he attempted to obtain a benefit through forgery. She also agreed that five years
is very impactful and it may be difficult for him to recover his academic career. It will
require a significant amount of hard work on his part to re-enroll and to graduate.

- 8PART 7 -THE DECISION ON PENALTY

28.

The Tribunal was satisfied that the joint submission on penalty must be accepted

as it does not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It further found that the
proposed penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.
PART 8 - THE ORDER

29.

Accordingly, the Panel imposes the following penalty:
(a)

that the Student is guilty of one count of forgery and one count of
academic misconduct, contrary to sections B.1.1 (a) and B.l.3(b) of the
Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters;

(b)

that the Student receive a final grade of zero in each of the following
courses:

(c)

(i)

GGR353H5F (Fall 2015)

(ii)

RLG204H5S (Winter 2016)

(iii)

GGR217H5S (Winter 2016)

(iv)

PSY362H5S (Winter 2016);

that the Student be immediately suspended from the University for a
period of five years, commencing on June 16, 2017 and ending on June
15, 2022;

(d)

that the sanction be recorded on the Student's academic record and
transcript to the effect that he was sanctioned for academic misconduct

-9-

commencing on June 16, 2017, and ending upon Mr. ~ · s
graduation from the University; and
(e)

that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of
the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed, with
the name of the Student withheld.

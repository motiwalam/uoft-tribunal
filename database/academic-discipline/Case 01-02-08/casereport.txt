Facts – V.A.
[5]
An Agreed Summary of Facts dated March 19, 2002 and signed by Mr. V.A. and Ms.
Rothstein was admitted into evidence. This Agreed Summary of Facts revealed the following
facts with respect to the charges against Mr. V.A.:
1. V.A. (“A.”) has been a student of the University of Toronto at Scarborough since the fall
of 1995. [A copy of Mr. V.A.’s academic record was attached as an appendix to the
Agreed Summary of Facts].
2.

In the summer of 2001 A. was a student in ECMB12H3S (Quantitative Methods and
Economics). The course was taught by Professor Admed. The evaluation scheme

And in the Matter of Disciplinary Charges Against A.H.
was on the basis of three assignments [the first two were worth four percent (4%) and
the third seven percent (7%)], a mid-term examination written on July 23, 2001 for
thirty-five percent (35%) and a final examination, on August 13, 2001, for fifty
percent (50%) of the final mark.
3.

A. did not write the final examination. Instead, with A.’s knowledge and consent,
A.H. (“H.”) impersonated A. at the final examination in ECMB12H3S.

4.

A. and H. were not close friends but had known each other for a number of years. A.
contacted H. in late June to obtain help in the course. He told H. that he had been
under a lot of stress and was having difficulty completing the course requirements.
He also told H. that he only needed a couple of credits in order to complete his degree
requirements. A. offered to compensate H. for his efforts.

5.

A. spoke to H. about getting his assistance with the course requirements on a number
of occasions.

6.

In July 2001, at A.’s request, H. provided A. with some suggested answers to one of
the course assignments worth 4% of the final mark. A. submitted the assignment
based on the assistance provided by H..

7.

Sometime during the course of A.’s and H.’s conversations, A. proposed the idea that
H. write the examination for him. Although he was not entirely serious at that [sic]
time he first made the suggestion, the conversation evolved to the point where A.
entered into a pre-meditated scheme to pay H. four hundred dollars ($400.00) to write
the examination in his place.

8.

A. acknowledges that he is guilty of (1) knowingly having H. impersonate him on an
academic exam and (2) knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection
with a term test or other form of academic work as set out in Charges 1 and 2
[attached as Appendix 2 to the Agreed Summary of Facts]

[6]
Mr. A. pled guilty to the two charges before the panel. After considering the facts
contained in the Agreed Summary of Facts, the Panel accepted Mr. A.’s guilty plea and found
him guilty on counts one and two.
Facts – A.H.
[7]
An Agreed Summary of Facts dated March 19, 2002 and signed by Mr. H. and Ms.

also asked H. to provide him with tutoring. H. declined.

3.

In July 2001, at A.’s request, H. provided A. with some suggested answers to a course

4.

Sometime during the course of A.’s and H.’s conversations, A. proposed the idea that
H. write the final examination for him. Although he was not entirely serious at that
time he first made the suggestion, the conversation evolved to the point where H.
agreed to write the final examination in ECMB12H3S for A. in return for the sum of
four hundred dollars ($400.00).

5.

The final examination on ECMB12H3S took place on August 13, 2001. It was worth

H. impersonated A. at the final examination.

6.

And in the Matter of Disciplinary Charges Against A.H.
3.

The case should be reported to the Provost to publish a notice of the decision of the
Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University newspapers, with
the name of the student withheld.

[10] In support of this Joint Submission, the University and Mr. A. agreed on the following
mitigating factors:
1.

The student acknowledged his guilty when first confronted with the allegations;

2.

The student expressed remorse to the Dean when first confronted with the allegations;

3.

The student has co-operated with the prosecution before the Tribunal and has
formally acknowledged his guilt;

4.

The student’s academic career has suffered as a result of a variety of chronic medical
problems that have interfered with this [sic] ability to devote his full attention to his
studies. He has been diagnosed with at chronic lumbosacral instability which
restricted his mobility, caused chronic severe lower back pain and a variety of other
sequelae. Medication prescribed has diminished his concentration and have from
time to time, made fulfillment of course requirements extremely difficult.

Submissions on Penalty – A.H.
[11] Mr. H. made an oral statement to the panel detailing the severe financial difficulties
suffered by his family and expressing remorse for his actions. Following Mr. H.’s statement, a
Joint Submission with Respect to Sanction was presented to the Panel. This Joint Submission
recommended the following sanctions with respect to Mr. H.:
1.

Suspension from the University for a period of five (5) years from the date of
decision;

2.

This sanction shall be recorded on the student’s academic record and transcript for
five (5) years from the date of this decision;

3.

The case should be reported to the Provost to publish a notice of the decision of the
Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University newspapers, with
the name of the student withheld.

[12] In support of this Joint Submission, the University and Mr. H. agreed on the following
mitigating factors:
1.

The student acknowledged his guilty when first confronted with the allegations;

- Page 5 of 7 -

In the Matter of Disciplinary Charges Against V.A.
And in the Matter of Disciplinary Charges Against A.H.
2.

The student expressed remorse to the Dean when first confronted with the allegations;

3.

The student has co-operated with the prosecution before the Tribunal and has
formally acknowledged his guilt;

4.

At the time that A.H. accepted V.A.’s offer to write the examination for the sum of
four hundred dollars ($400), A.H. was extremely concerned about his family’s
financial situation. A.H. lives with his mother and sister. His mother is the sole
source of financial support for him and his sister. His family receives no financial
support from A.H.’s father. Due to medical problems, A.H.’s mother has been on
social assistance for a number of years. A.H. had been force to complete his studies
on a part-time basis in order to work full-time to support the family.
REASONS FOR SANCTION (Delivered Orally)

[13] The Panel accepted the Joint Submission with respect to Mr. A.. The Panel did not
accept the Joint Submission with respect to Mr. H. and elected to substitute a sentence that
provides for a four-year suspension rather than a five-year suspension.
[14] The Panel expressed a desire to differentiate between the penalty imposed upon Mr. H.
from that imposed upon Mr. A. The panel felt that some consideration had to be given to the fact
that Mr. A. was the initiator. The panel also felt that Mr. A.’s greater experience and maturity
might have been brought to bear to prevent the incidents from occurring.
[15] The panel was concerned with the candor of certain submissions made by Mr. A. In
particular, the panel had some difficulty with the mitigating medical circumstances. The Panel
was grateful to have those issues clarified in subsequent questions asked by the Panel. The
answers received were very helpful in clarifying why certain questions arose from materials
submitted to the Panel. Many of the Panel’s concerns were allayed by the answers to the
questions posed to Mr. A..
[16] Finally the Panel wished to differentiate the penalties simply in the hope that it would
promote a sense of rehabilitation and understanding of the seriousness of the offense. The Panel
did not want to express its desire to differentiate by imposing a more serious sentence than that
which was recommended jointly. The Panel indicated that it had immense difficulty with the
joint submissions in regard to the assurances that there would be sufficient deterrence by the
significant reduction in the expected sentences.

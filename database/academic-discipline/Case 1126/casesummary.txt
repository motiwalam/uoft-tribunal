   Theâ¯Studentâ¯was chargedÂ with two counts ofÂ knowingly
   representingÂ the ideas of another, or the expressions of the ideas of
   another, asÂ herÂ own workÂ in a test and a final exam, contrary to
   s.Â B.i.1(d)â¯of theâ¯Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters,
   1995â¯(theÂ âCodeâ).â¯In the alternative,Â the Student was charged with
   two countsÂ of knowingly obtaining unauthorizedÂ assistance in
   connection with a test and a final exam, contrary to s. B.i.1(b) of the
   Code.Â In theÂ furtherÂ alternative, theâ¯Studentâ¯was chargedÂ with
   two countsÂ ofÂ knowingly engagingÂ in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct,Â fraudÂ or misrepresentationâ¯in order
   toâ¯obtain academic credit or other academic advantageâ¯in connection
   withÂ a test and a final exam,Â under s.â¯B.i.3(b) of theâ¯Code.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of
   theâ¯Studentâ¯appeared at the hearing.Â The University provided
   evidence that theâ¯Studentâ¯had been servedÂ with the chargesÂ and the
   Notice of Electronic HearingÂ via email toÂ herÂ ROSI-listed email
   address.â¯The UniversityÂ filed evidenceÂ demonstrating attempts to
   contact the Student via email which included invitations for
   discussions, efforts to arrange scheduling of the hearing, disclosure
   of materials, and reminders of the hearing.Â Theâ¯Studentâ¯was
   subsequently provided an opportunity to provide submissions in relation
   to the request ofâ¯theÂ Assistant Discipline Counselâ¯for the hearing
   to proceed electronicallyâ¯due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Theâ¯Studentâ¯did not respond to this request and the hearing was
   ordered to proceed electronically.â¯The
   charges,â¯notice,Â andÂ emailÂ correspondenceÂ to theâ¯Studentâ¯went
   unanswered.â¯â¯Given the foregoing,Â the PanelÂ found that the Student
   was provided with reasonable notice and proper service as outlined
   inÂ rules 9 andÂ 14 of the University TribunalâsÂ Rules of Practice and
   ProcedureÂ andÂ as such, the PanelÂ ordered that the hearingÂ proceed
   in theâ¯Studentâsâ¯absence.

   Regarding the charges laid under s.Â B.i.1(d)â¯of
   theâ¯Code,Â theâ¯PanelÂ received affidavit evidenceÂ ofâ¯theÂ professor
   who taughtâ¯the course for which theÂ test and the final examÂ in
   question wereÂ submitted.â¯TheÂ professorâs evidence outlined that
   after theÂ exams were submitted the instructors and the teaching
   assistants in the course foundÂ a number ofÂ questions and
   answersÂ forÂ both the test and the final exam on
   Chegg.comÂ (âCheggâ).Â It was later discovered that someone had posted
   questionsÂ and answersÂ from the test and the final exam on Chegg
   during the 24 hour-period of both examinations.Â An examination of the
   answers provided by the Student and thoseÂ postedÂ on Chegg revealed
   striking similarities. For example, the manner in which theÂ problems
   wereÂ solvedÂ and the steps taken in those solutions were the same and
   unusual.Â Further, both set of answers contained missing steps.Â Â The
   Panel agreed thatÂ the similarities between theÂ answersÂ of the
   Student and those found on Chegg showed, on a balance of probabilities,
   that the Student somehowÂ cameÂ into possession of the answers posted
   on CheggÂ and copied themÂ intoÂ the answers she ultimately
   submitted.Â The Panel noted that the evidence did not show that the
   Student was the one who posted the questions on Chegg or that she
   received the answers from Chegg;Â all that could be said was that the
   Student directly or indirectly came into possession of those answers
   and improperly relied on them.Â Given all the evidence, the Panel found
   the Student guilty ofÂ two counts of knowingly representing an idea or
   expression of an idea ofÂ work of another asÂ herÂ own, contrary to s.
   B.i.1(d) of the Code.

   In determining sanction,â¯theâ¯Panel considered theÂ guidance outlined
   in theÂ Provostâs Guidance on Sanctions in AppendixÂ âCâÂ of the Code.
   Section B.8(b) provides that at the Tribunal level,Â âabsent
   exceptional circumstances, theÂ Provost will request that the Tribunal
   suspendÂ aÂ student for two years for any offence involving academic
   dishonesty, where a student had not committed any prior offences.âÂ The
   University drew the attention of the Panel toÂ a number ofÂ factors
   that they say call for a higher sanction than that contemplated in the
   Code.Â First, the University notedÂ that the Student failed to
   participateÂ in the process which goes to the character of the Student
   and that there is no evidence of remorse, mitigating circumstancesÂ or
   acknowledgement from the Student that this behaviour will not be
   repeated.Â Second,Â the University noted that there was a financial or
   commercial aspect to these offencesÂ thatÂ elevatesÂ their
   seriousness.Â Finally, the University noted that the behaviour was
   repeated as it was in relation to two separate tests.Â The Panel
   disagreed with the University that the Studentâs non-participation can
   be used as an aggravating factor.Â The Panel noted thatÂ while a
   failure to participate robs the Student of the ability to present
   evidence of remorse or mitigating factorsÂ that may reduce a sanction,
   the non-presentation of that evidence does not itself represent an
   aggravating factor that can be used to increase
   sanction.Â Similarly,Â although aÂ studentâs assurance that the
   behaviour will not be repeated can act as a mitigating factor, the
   Panel noted that there is no onus on the Student to provide such
   assurancesÂ such that an absence is an aggravating factor.Â Based on
   the evidence outlinedÂ atÂ the hearing, the PanelÂ determined that
   sinceÂ it wasÂ unable to conclude whether theÂ Student was a subscriber
   to CheggÂ or that she was aware that the answers she used
   wereÂ retrieved from that site, the commercial nature of the site could
   not be used an as aggravating factor.Â Regarding the repetition of the
   behaviour in questionÂ the Panel noted that althoughÂ teaching staff
   reached out to the Student prior to the second offence, there is
   noÂ evidence that the Student reviewed that correspondence.
   Therefore,Â the University had not proven thatÂ the Student repeated
   the behaviour after being notified that it was unacceptable.Â The Panel
   further noted that both offences took place in the initial weeks of the
   COVID-19 pandemic as lockdowns swept OntarioÂ and thus, it was
   reasonable to assume that the global upheaval during those weeks had a
   negative effect on the Student.Â The Panel did not impose theÂ sanction
   requested on behalf of the University.Â However, given the serious
   nature of the offence and absence of any mitigating factors, the Panel
   found that a substantial sanctionÂ was an appropriate
   one.Â Theâ¯Panelâ¯imposedâ¯the following sanctions:â¯a final grade of
   zero in the course;â¯aâ¯two-year suspension;â¯aâ¯three-year notation on
   the transcript; andâ¯aâ¯report to theÂ Provost for a publication.

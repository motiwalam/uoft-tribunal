Decision of the Tribunal

[6]

On the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Tribunal accepted the plea and found
contraventions of the Code as set out in the principal charges (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, II, 13 and 15).
At this time, the University withdrew the alternative charges (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and
16).

Penalty Phase

[7]

The student filed a series of documents on sanctions which included previous medical
information and information about the student's fmancial situation. In addition, the
student was affirmed and read a pre-written statement to the Panel. The Panel views the
contents of the statement as important, and therefore reproduces it here in full:
Dear Members of the Panel,
I am writing this statement to express my remorse for my academic offenses at the University of
Toronto. I am deeply ashamed ofmy behaviour, and saddened by the negative impacts this event
has had on the University, my family, my doctor, and my fel1ow students. This situation is
especially troubling at this point in time, as I am currently a few courses away from graduating at

the University of Toronto.
There are no excuses for my conduct. However, it is relevant that I explain how I ended up in this
position. This way, the University may be in a better position to understand the reasons for my
actions, and use that knowledge to prevent other students from making the same mistakes.
At the time of the offenses, I lived with my single mother and two younger sisters. I have been the

only male in my household since I was 8 years old. My family has previously been on welfare. My
mother, who speaks very little English, is currently working 50 hours a week on an assembly line.

She has an annual income that is less than $20,000, and I have accrued approximately $30,000 in
OSAP debt to fund my education.

11
From a very young age, I have been charged with the responsibility of cooking and cleaning for
my two younger sisters, as well as attending to many other household chores. I also have the
responsibility of paying my family's bills and tending to the majority of our administrative matters.
While I was enrolled at UTM, my daily commute between my home and campus was
approximately 3 hours, The demands of my family situation have prevented me from getting
involved in any extra-curricular activities at the University.
I see my education as necessary to improve my family's economic situation. This has resulted in

an intense pressure I feel to succeed. Without a degree, I am concerned that I will be unable to find
employment that can improve the standard of living for my mother and sisters. Furthennore, my
family will be burdened with a $30,000 debt that will be extremely difficult to repay without my
post-secondary education, and the employment opportunities that follow.
This continuous pressure has been the cause of the aILxiety I began to experience while preparing
and writing my exams at the University. I realize that it is common for many students to
experience exam-related anxiety, but I have found the severity of my reactions to be
uncharacteristic of typical stress or tension. Prior to exams, I would experience symptoms such as:
panic attacks, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and high fever. Before the start of my fourth year,
my relationship with my former girlfriend of three years came to a difficult end. This event further
exacerbated the stress I felt at the time.
I first visited a doctor about my aILxiety in 2004, and received a medical note that allowed me to
defer an exam. I continued [to] visit my doctor and receive valid medical certificates for my
symptoms between 2004 and 2008. Over time, this process became so routine to me, that I decided
to fill out and submit the certificates myself.
I understand that the number of times that I have visited a medical professional is irrelevant to the
need to obtain a valid medical certificate for each exam deferral. I recognize that I have made a
serious mistake, for which I accept complete responsibility. My only hope is that the panel allows
me the opportunity to complete my degree, and gives me the chance to represent the University
positively as a hard working alumnus in my future career. I strongly value the chance to learn from
my error. I also wish that my case will serve as a strong reminder to my colleagues of the need to
follow the University's academic policies correctly at all times.
Thank you for your consideration.
Respectfully,

[9]

The Tribunal was reminded by counsel that, while not obliged to accept a joint
submission on penalty, the joint submission should not be rejected unless to accept it
would be contrary to the public interest or bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The Panel accepts and acknowledges that this is a high threshold for declining
to accept a joint submission.

[10]

In reaching its decision, the Panel paid regard to the facts in this case, in particular the
aggravating fact that the offences occuned in several courses o,;er a period of time, and
the significant mitigating facts, which included those set out in the student's statement
above, as well as the student's guilty plea and engagement and co-operation in this
process. The Panel also had regard to previous Tribunal cases brought to the Panel's
attention. The Panel was lmanimously of the view that the joint submission was at the
high end of the appropriate range, but was still within that range, such that it ought to be
accepted.

Sanction

order:

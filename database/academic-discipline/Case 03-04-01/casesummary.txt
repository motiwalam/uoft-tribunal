   Student charged under s. B.i.1(d), s. B.i.1(b), and alternatively,
   under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code. The charges related to allegations that
   the Student submitted a final test, portions of which were not written
   by her, and that during the test she used or possessed an unauthorized
   aid or obtained unauthorized assistance. The Student pleaded not guilty
   to the charges. It was not in dispute that passages in the Student‚s
   examination booklet were identical to passages found from a website
   printout. The Student claimed that she unconsciously memorized portions
   of the website from her study notes and then inadvertently reproduced
   the material in her answers. The Panel adjourned the hearing sine die
   for the purposes of obtaining an expert examination of the Student‚s
   memory abilities. The Student refused testing in the hearing interlude.
   The Panel accepted the qualifications of a human memory expert and
   considered his opinion evidence that it was not possible that a student
   could unconsciously memorize study notes. The Panel found that the
   Student‚s explanation was not believable because the only other example
   of her remarkable memory offered was her mother‚s recollection of her
   ability to give an oral presentation she had consciously memorized. The
   Panel found that while it did not how the Student accessed the website
   or her study notes during the period of the test, there was no other
   explanation for how the material was reproduced. The Panel found that
   the University has provided clear and convincing evidence that the
   Student violated the Code and found her guilty of the offences under s.
   B.i.1(d)and s. B.i.1(b) of the Code. The Panel found that the Student
   had not admitted the offences and therefore she had not shown any
   remorse for them, and that she had no prior offences. The Panel found
   that the notation of the imposed sanction on the Student‚s transcript
   should only be for the same period as the suspension because the
   Student may potentially complete her coursework for her degree in the
   term in which the hearing occurred and that the effect of a three-year
   notation might be to delay the resumption of her academic career beyond
   the two-year period of the suspension, which would be inappropriate in
   the circumstances. The Panel imposed a grade of zero in the course; a
   two-year suspension; a two-year notation on the Students academic
   record and transcript; and that a report be issued to the Provost.

AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS

3.

The hearing proceeded, on consent, by way of an Agreed Statement of Facts (the
“Agreed Statement” or “ASF”). Included as part of the submission of the Agreed
Statement was a Book of Documents (Re: Finding of Offence) which was marked
as Exhibit 1 at the hearing.

4.

The Agreed Statement provides as follows:
1.

This matter arises out of charges of academic misconduct filed on

November 14, 2023 (the “Charges”) by the Provost of the University of
Toronto (the “Provost” and the “University”) under the Code of Behaviour
on Academic Matters (the “Code”). The Provost and D

B

(the

“Student”) have prepared this Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) and a
Joint Book of Documents (“JBD”). The Provost and the Student agree that:
(a) each document contained in the JBD may be admitted into
evidence for all purposes, including for the truth of the document’s
contents (unless otherwise indicated in this ASF), without further
need to prove the document; and
(b) if a document indicates that it was sent or received by someone,
that is prima facie proof that the document was sent and received
as indicated (unless otherwise indicated in this ASF).
2.

The Student acknowledges that he has received a copy of the charges,

waives the reading of the charges, and pleads guilty to all charges. A copy
of the charges is included in the JBD at Tab 1.
3.

The Provost agrees that if the Tribunal returns a conviction on charges

1, 3, 6, and 10, the Provost will withdraw the remaining alternative charges.

-94.

The Student admits that he received a copy of the Notice of Virtual

Hearing in this matter and that he has received reasonable notice of this
hearing. A copy of the Notice of Virtual Hearing is included in the JBD at
Tab 2.
A. The Student’s Academic History
5.

The Student first registered with the University of Toronto Mississauga

(“UTM”) in Fall 2018. He has completed 6.5 credits and has a cumulative
GPA of 1.37. The Student was placed on academic probation after the
Winter 2019 term due to a low cumulative GPA. The Student served a oneyear suspension following the Fall 2019 term. The Student returned to UTM
for the Fall 2020 term. The Student was again placed on academic
probation following the Winter 2021, Winter 2022, and Winter 2023 terms.
The Student has not enrolled in courses at the University since the Winter
2023 term ended. A copy of the Student’s academic record is included in
the JBD at Tab 3.
B. MAT102H5S 2021(5) – Summer 2021
6.

In the Summer 2021 term, the Student was enrolled in MAT102H5

2021(5): Introduction to Mathematical Proofs (“MAT102”), taught by Nadya
Askaripour and Angel Martinez.
7.

The syllabus for MAT102 contained a section on Academic Integrity

(on page 4) which stated, among other things, that the work students
submitted was required to be their own and could not contain anyone else’s
work or ideas without proper attribution. It also stated that students were
expected to read a handout about how not to plagiarize and to be familiar
with the Code. A copy of the MAT102 syllabus is included in the JBD at
Tab 4.
8.

As part of the MAT102 course requirements, students were required

to write a term test worth 24% of their final grade (the “MAT102 Term Test”).
The MAT102 Term Test was conducted virtually on July 8, 2021. It
consisted of seven questions. Students had 90 minutes to answer the

- 10 questions, with an additional 20 minutes to upload and submit their answer
files for each question through Crowdmark. The instructions for the
MAT102 Term Test are included in the JBD at Tab 5.
9.

Students were permitted to access only their class notes and the

textbook; they were not permitted to access any other sources. The first
page of the MAT102 Term Test instructions set out the rules about what
materials could and could not be used:
-You are allowed to use your class notes and the textbook. . You
are allowed to use your own knowledge and understanding of the
course material. You are expected to solve the problems on your
own, without external assistance. You are not allowed to use any
other aids. You may not transmit or receive information from any
other individual, whether in person, digitally, or by some other
means. You may not access the internet, except to download and
print your test, and to submit it digitally through Crowdmark.
10. As part of the MAT102 Term Test, students were required to sign an
academic integrity declaration, which stated:
In submitting this test, I confirm that my conduct during this test
adheres to the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. I confirm
that I did NOT act in such a way that would constitute cheating,
misrepresentation, or unfairness, including but not limited to, using
unauthorized aids and assistance, impersonating another person,
and committing plagiarism.
11. The Student submitted his answers for the MAT102 Term Test on
Crowdmark on July 8, 2021. The Student did not complete the academic
integrity declaration. A copy of the Student’s MAT102 Term Test
submission, written in Booklet 178, is included in the JBD at Tab 6.
12. During the marking process, the Teaching Assistant who graded
question 4 advised Ms. Askaripour that they had identified similarities
between the Student’s answer for question 4 and the answer submitted by
Kiara Callendar (“K.C.”), another student in MAT102. The Teaching
Assistant also informed Ms. Askaripour that both the Student and K.C.’s
answers for question 4 were incorrect.

- 11 13. A copy of K.C.’s MAT102 Term Test submission is included in the JBD
at Tab 7.
14. Question 4 asked students whether a given set (ℚ ∩ (-1; 1)) with usual
addition and multiplication was a field. A field is a set with at least two
elements and two operations that satisfy some axioms or rules (“Field
Axioms”). Question 4 was not a true or false question; rather, students were
expected to answer whether the given set was or was not a field. If the set
was a field, students were expected to prove this; if the set was not a field,
students were expected to show that at least one of the Field Axioms failed
using a counterexample.
15. The correct answer to question 4 was that the given set was not a field.
There was a range of possible counterexamples that could be given to
correctly answer question 4, and these could be represented in different
ways. There were also several Field Axioms that failed in the given set.
Accordingly, when Ms. Askaripour reviewed the MAT102 Term Tests that
students submitted, she saw a range of answers to question 4 from
students who answered this question.
16. After being notified about the similarities between the Student’s and
K.C.’s test answers, Ms. Askaripour reviewed the Student’s MAT102 Term
Test and K.C.’s MAT102 Term Test. Upon reviewing, Ms. Askaripour
identified that their answers to question 4 were nearly identical.
17. In particular, the Student and K.C.’s answers to question 4 were
incorrect and illogical in the same ways. The similar illogical and/or unusual
aspects of their answers included:
(a) the Student and K.C. answered question 4 in a general way, using
“a” and “b”, rather than using numbers to provide numerical
counterexamples. This was unusual and contrary to what students
are taught: if they want to prove that something is not a field, they
should use a specific numerical counterexample (rather than
variables such as “a” and “b”). The majority of students who

- 12 answered question 4 in the MAT102 Term Test used numerical
counterexamples;
(b) neither the Student nor K.C. included an explanation about what
“a” and “b” represented in their equations, nor did they include any
explanation of what assumptions were being made about those
variables in their answers. As a result, the Student and K.C.’s
answers to question 4 included characters and variables that did
not have much meaning (because they were missing the
necessary explanation);
(c) question 4 did not ask students to indicate if the answer was true
or false, yet both the Student and K.C. answered that it was false;
and
(d) the Student and K.C.’s answers both stated that the given set
broke the “Rule of Inverses”. The more commonly used
terminology is the Axiom of Inverses, although both are correct to
use.
18. A side-by-side of the Student and K.C.’s answers to question 4 of the
MAT102 Term Test is included below, and in the JBD at Tab 8:

19. During her review of the Student and K.C.’s MAT102 Term Tests, Ms.
Askaripour also identified similarities in the Student and K.C.’s answers to
question 3. In particular, she identified that:
(a) the Student and K.C. both used “G” as a variable in their equations
which

was

very

uncommon.

Students

in

MAT102

had

- 13 encountered questions similar to question 3 in the course
materials, and “G” was not used as a variable in the solutions for
those questions. The Student and K.C. were the only two students
to use the variable “G” to answer question 3; and
(b) the Student and K.C.’s answers were structured similarly. The way
that the Student and K.C. structured their answers (for instance,
“G = (a,b)”) differed from how the majority of the other students
who answered question 3 structured their answers (which was
“(x,y) ← A”).
20. A side-by-side comparison of the Student and K.C.’s answers to
question 3 is included in the JBD at Tab 9.
21. Given the nature and extent of the similarities she observed in the
Student and K.C.’s answers, Ms. Askaripour concluded that it was very
likely they worked together or shared their work to questions 3 and 4 with
one another, or obtained their answers from the same source. In her
experience, it was very unlikely that the Student and K.C. could have
written such highly similar answers by coincidence.
22. Ms. Askaripour met with the Student to discuss her concerns about the
Student’s MAT102 Term Test on July 29, 2021. Ms. Askaripour also met
with K.C. in a separate meeting.
C. CSC148 2021(5) – Summer 2021
23. In Summer 2021 the Student was also enrolled in CSC148H5:
Introduction to Computer Science (“CSC148 2021”). CSC148 2021 was
taught by Professor Ilir Dema and Michael Miljanovic.
24. K.C. was also enrolled in CSC148 2021.
25. The CSC148 2021 syllabus contained a detailed Academic Integrity
section (on page 3) that emphasized the importance of academic integrity
and advised that the University takes academic offences seriously. The

- 14 Code was hyperlinked in this section of the syllabus. The Academic
Integrity section included the following:
The work you submit must be your own. It is an academic offence
to copy someone else's work, with or without changes. This
includes their code, their words, and even their ideas. Whether
you copy or let someone else copy, it is an academic offence…
At the same time, we want you to benefit from working with other
students. You are welcome to work appropriately with other
students. To clarify, it is appropriate to discuss course material
and technology related to assignments, and we encourage you to
do so. For example, you may work through examples that help
you understand course material or new technology or help each
other configure your system to run a supporting piece of software.
You may also discuss assignment requirements.
However, collaboration on preps or assignment solutions is
strictly forbidden. The most certain way to protect yourself is not
to discuss solutions or the ideas behind them with other students.
Certainly, you must not let others see your solutions, even in draft
form. Please don't cheat. We want you to succeed and are here
to help if you are having difficulty.
26. A copy of the syllabus for CSC148 2021 is included in the JBD at Tab
10.
27. As part of the CSC148 2021 requirements, students were required to
submit two assignments that were each worth 15%. Assignment 2
(“CSC148 2021 Assignment 2”) was due on August 13, 2021.
28. The Student submitted CSC148 2021 Assignment 2 as required.
29. The Student’s CSC148 2021 Assignment 2 was submitted to Measure
of Software Similarity (“MOSS”). MOSS detects programming and coding
similarities and is used as a plagiarism detection program for software.
MOSS creates a report identifying similarities in the structure and content
of code in two assignments, and uses colour coding to identify similar code
fragments (including similar fragments that differ slightly due to cosmetic
changes). Black text in a MOSS report typically indicates code that was
given to a student – such as assignment instructions or starter code – or
code that is sufficiently different as between assignments. Coloured text

- 15 typically indicates similarities in code fragments and colour matches
identify the similar pieces of code in the two pieces of work.1
30. MOSS identified similarities in the codes submitted by the Student and
by K.C. in their CSC148 2021 Assignment 2. The MOSS report indicated a
22% similarity index between the code in their assignments. An annotated
excerpt of the MOSS report for the Student’s and K.C.’s CSC148 2021
Assignment 2 is included in the JBD at Tab 11 and below.
31. Upon review, Professor Dema identified that both students’ CSC148
2021 Assignment 2 contained two pieces of identical code, coloured in red
and blue in the MOSS report. The pieces of identical code were as follows:

32. Professor Dema met with the Student via Zoom to discuss CSC148
2021 Assignment 2. Professor Dema also met with K.C. via Zoom. At her
meeting, K.C. admitted that she discussed parts of the solutions for
CSC148 2021 Assignment 2 with other students.
D. Meetings with Dean’s Designates about MAT102 and CSC148 2021

1

MOSS may not identify all similarities in two assignments. It is also possible that MOSS will identify
content that is given to students (either as starter code or assignment instructions) as similarities (using
colour matches) in the MOSS report. Accordingly, MOSS reports are a tool used to detect plagiarism
but human review is nevertheless required.

- 16 1.

The Student’s Dean’s Meeting

33. On February 24, 2022, the Student met with Professor Timothy Yusun,
Dean’s Designate for Academic Offences at UTM to discuss the allegations
in respect of the MAT201 Term Test and CSC148 2021 Assignment 2. The
Student was accompanied by a representative from Downtown Legal
Services. Professor Yusun read the Student the required warnings from the
Code.
34. During the meeting, the Student admitted to receiving unauthorized
assistance for the MAT102 Term Test. He said he had used notes from a
prior semester which he had received from K.C. to write the test.
35. The Student also admitted at this meeting to receiving unauthorized
assistance to complete his CSC148 2021 Assignment 2. He said that: he
sent K.C. his code to test it for him; he thought K.C. may have forgotten to
take out the piece of code in her CSC148 2021 Assignment 2 before she
submitted her assignment; and he had done poorly on the first assignment
in CSC148 2021 and knew he needed to do better on CSC148 2021
Assignment 2 because the Computer Sciences major required an 80% in
the course.
36. Towards the end of the meeting, the Student read out a statement in
which he apologized for his mistakes and said he was ashamed of his
actions and that he had sought out resources and advice about how to
prevent similar incidents in the future. The Student asked that he be given
the chance to prove that mistakes like these would not happen again.
37. The matters were forwarded to the Vice-Provost’s office.
2.

K. C.’s Dean’s Meeting

38. On April 8, 2022, K.C. met with Professor Shay Fuchs, Dean’s
Designate for Academic Offences at UTM. K.C. admitted to obtaining
unauthorized assistance in the MAT102 Term Test and to obtaining
unauthorized assistance to complete CSC148 2021 Assignment 2. K.C.

- 17 gave a similar explanation to the explanation given by the Student about
CSC148 2021 Assignment 2. K.C. was sanctioned by Professor Fuchs.
E.

CSC148 2022(1) – Winter 2022

39. In Winter 2022, the Student enrolled again in CSC148H5S 2022(1):
Introduction to Computer Science (“CSC148 2022”). CSC148 2022 was
taught by Pooja Vashisth and Professor Bogdan Simion.
40. The CSC148 2022 syllabus contained a detailed Academic Integrity
section (on pages 5 and 6). A copy of the CSC148 2022 syllabus is included
in the JBD at Tab 12.
41. The Academic Integrity section of the CSC48 2022 syllabus linked the
Code and provided examples of potential academic offences, including that
it may be an offence in papers and assignments to “[use] someone else’s
ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgment” and “[obtain] or
[provide] unauthorized assistance on any assignment”. The syllabus also
provided several tips for students to help them avoid committing an
academic offence, including:
Never look at another student’s lab/assignment solution(s). Never
show another student your lab/assignment solution. This applies
to all drafts of a solution and to incomplete and even incorrect
solutions.
42. The Academic Integrity section of the CSC148 2022 syllabus also
contained similar instructions to those in the CSC148 2021 syllabus
(excerpted above at paragraph 25), as follows:
The work you submit must be your own. It is an academic offence
to copy someone else's work, with or without changes. This
includes their code, their words, and even their ideas. Whether
you copy or let someone else copy, it is an academic offence.
The department uses software that compares programs for
evidence of similar code. Academic offences are taken very
seriously.
At the same time, we want you to benefit from working with other
students…You are also welcome to work appropriately with other
students. To clarify, it is appropriate to discuss course material

- 18 and technology related to assignments, and we encourage you to
do so. For example, you may work through examples that help
you understand course material or a new technology, or help each
other configure your system to run a supporting piece of software.
You may also discuss assignment requirements.
However, collaboration on preps or assignment solutions is
strictly forbidden. The most certain way to protect yourself is not
to discuss solutions or the ideas behind them with other students.
Certainly you must not let others see your solutions, even in draft
form. Please don't cheat. We want you to succeed and are here
to help if you are having difficulty.
43. As part of the CSC148 2022 requirements, students were required to
submit two assignments that were each worth 15% of their final grade in
the CSC148 2022 (“CSC148 2022 Assignment 1” and “CSC148 2022
Assignment 2”, respectively). 1. CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 44. CSC148
2022 Assignment 1 was due on February 22, 2022. CSC148 2022
Assignment 1 was called “The MewbileTech phone company”. Students
were required to develop a software program to help a mobile phone
company track historic customer data. Students were required to complete
a warmup task, five coding tasks (including sub-tasks for each), and a
written component. The five tasks included Task 3 “Contracts” (“Task 3”)
and Task 4 “Filtering events and displaying bills” (“Task 4”). A copy of the
CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 instructions are included in the JBD at Tab
13.
45. The CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 instructions for the coding portion
included general guidelines for the assignment (on page 2), including that
students must complete the assignment individually.
46. To complete CSC148 2022 Assignment 1, students were provided with
starter code. A copy of the starter code files provided to students for this
assignment are included in the JBD at Tab 14 (A-M).

47. The Student submitted CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 as required.
48. As part of the grading process, all CSC148 2022 Assignment 1
submissions were run through MOSS.

- 19 49. MOSS detected similarities between the Student’s Task 3 and Task 4
submissions for CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 and the assignments
submitted by four other students in CSC148 2022: Khahn Nguyen (“K.N.”);
Mohamed Omar (“M.O.”); Shaoze Zhang (“S.Z.”); and Yitong Zhou (“Y.Z.”).
Task 3 – Contract
50. For Task 3, MOSS identified similarities between the Student’s code
and the code submitted by each of M.O., K.N., and Y.Z. In particular:
(a) MOSS identified that 55% of the Student’s Task 3 code was
similar to M.O.’s Task 3 code. The MOSS report for the Student’s
and M.O’s Task 3 code and an annotated side-by-side
comparison2 of their Task 3 codes are included in the JBD at Tab
15 and Tab 16, respectively;
(b) MOSS identified that 45% of the Student’s Task 3 code was
similar to K.N.’s Task 3 code. The MOSS report for the Student’s
and K.N.’s Task 3 code and an annotated side-by-side
comparison of their Task 3 codes are included in the JBD at Tab
17 and Tab 18, respectively; and
(c) MOSS identified that 39% of the Student’s Task 3 code was
similar to Y.Z.’s Task 3 code. The MOSS report for the Student
and Y.Z.’s Task 3 code and an annotated side-by-side comparison
of their Task 3 codes are included in the JBD at Tab 19 and Tab
20, respectively.
The Student and M.O.
51. Professor Simion reviewed the Student and M.O.’s Task 3 codes. He
found that most of the docstrings in the Student and M.O.’s codes were

2

The annotations indicate what lines of the students’ code each colour match corresponds to. As noted
above, the MOSS reports may not identify all similarities in two assignments, and may flag content
that was given to students as similarities (using colour matches). According to Professor Simion,
content that was given to students is indicated between three quotation marks (""") in the MOSS
reports. The lines of code are set out on the first page of each MOSS report.

- 20 virtually identical. He also found that the “free_minutes” description in the
TermContract docstring was identical and that there was identical unusual
indentation for several lines in the “Public Attributes” section of code, which
included the “free_minutes” description.
52. In respect of the indentation, Professor Simion observed that in the
“Public Attributes” section of the Student and M.O.’s Task 3, the line of code
stating “end date for the contract” (underneath “end”) was indented less
than the line of code stating “amount of free call minutes given to a
customer each month” (underneath “free_minutes”), which in turn was
indented more than the line of code stating “indicated of whether end date
of contract passed or not” (underneath “expired”). The amount of
indentation of each of these lines of code differed from the others. As
shown in green in the MOSS report excerpt below (and at page 128 of the
JBD at Tab 16, between lines 73-107 in M.O.’s code and lines 85-119 in
the Student’s code), M.O. and the Student’s code both included the same
unusual indentation for the code in the “Public Attributes” section.

53. As described below, Professor Simion also observed identical
indentation in this section of Y.Z.’s Task 3 code.
54. In Professor Simion’s experience, these similarities could not occur by
pure coincidence. This is because students had to implement the “Public
Attributes” section of code on their own, as it was not provided in the starter
code. To achieve the particular indentations shown above, the students
would have had to manually input all of the spaces themselves into each
line of code, and to have done so in exactly the same way.

- 21 55. Based on his review, Professor Simion suspected that entire portions
of code had been copied and that the Student and M.O. had not worked
independently on their codes.
The Student and K.N.
56. Professor Simion reviewed the Student’s and K.N.’s Task 3 codes. He
found that both students included identical docstrings. In particular,
Professor Simion found that both the Student and K.N. used an identical
attribute in the “TermContract” with identical grammatically incorrect
descriptions – “indicated of whether end date of contract passed or not” –
as shown in the first line of green text in the MOSS report excerpt below
(and at page 141 of the JBD at Tab 18, at line 102 in the Student’s code
and line 105 in K.N.’s code):

57. M.O.’s code also included the identical grammatically incorrect
description of this attribute in the “TermContract” (at page 141 of the JBD
at Tab 16, in/around line 90 in M.O.’s code).
58. Overall, Professor Simion identified entire passages of code in the
Student and K.N.’s Task 3 code, including identical docstrings, that he
suspected had been copied from each other or another unauthorized
source. His impression was that the students had made cosmetic changes
to the code in an effort to obscure the similarities in their codes. In Professor
Simion’s experience, these similarities could not have arisen by sheer
coincidence.
The Student and Y.Z

- 22 59. Professor Simion reviewed the Student and Y.Z.’s Task 3 codes.
Based on his review, Professor Simion identified entire passages of code
in the Student and Y.Z.’s CSC148 2022 Assignment 1 that he suspected
were copied from each other or another unauthorized source. The
similarities he observed included docstrings that students had to write
themselves from scratch that were too similar in both the Student’s and
Y.Z.’s Task 3 code to have occurred by coincidence.
60. In particular, Professor Simion observed identical indentation of the
Student and Y.Z.’s code in the “Public Attributes” section of code. In
particular, Professor Simion identified that “end date for the contract”
(under “end”) was indented less than “amount of free call minutes given to
customers each month” (under “free_minutes”), which in turn was indented
more than the line of code under “expired” (in the Student’s code) and
“active” (in Y.Z.’s code). The level of indentation in each of these lines of
code was identical in the Student and Y.Z.’s code, as shown in red in the
MOSS report excerpt below (and at page 154 of the JBD at Tab 20, at lines
94-102 in the Student’s code and lines 94-101 of Y.Z.’s code). In Professor
Simion’s experience, this similarity could not happen by pure coincidence
for the same reasons described above in paragraph 54.

61. As noted above in paragraphs 51-53, Professor Simion also identified
similarities in the indentation of the Student and M.O.’s “Public Attributes”
code for their Task 3 code. The indentation was the same across the
Student, M.O.’s, and Y.Z.’s code. Professor Simion compared this section
of three students’ code, and observed that the wording in this section of the
Student and M.O.’s code was identical and that Y.Z.’s code was largely the
same, except for cosmetic changes in the last two lines of this section of
code (for instance, changing “active” to “expired”).

- 23 Task 4 – Filter
62. For Task 4, MOSS identified similarities between the Student’s code
and the code submitted by M.O. and S.Z. In particular:
(a) MOSS identified that 34% of the Student’s Task 4 code was
similar to M.O.’s Task 4 code. The MOSS report for the Student
and M.O.’s Task 4 code and an annotated side-by-side
comparison of their Task 4 code are included in the JBD at Tab
21 and Tab 22, respectively.
(b) MOSS identified that 25% of the Student’s Task 4 code was
similar to Y.Z.’s Task 4 code. The MOSS report for the Student
and Y.Z.’s Task 4 code and an annotated side-by-side comparison
of their Task 4 code are included in the JBD at Tab 23 and Tab
24, respectively.
The Student and M.O.
63. Professor Simion reviewed the Student and M.O.’s Task 4 codes. He
identified similarities in their codes, including identical docstrings and that
the Student and M.O. listed the “Error” types in the exact same order in
their ‘apply’ methods. Professor Simion was of the view that these
similarities could not have occurred by coincidence. He suspected that
entire portions of code had been copied and that the Student and M.O. had
not worked independently on their codes.
The Student and S.Z.
64. Professor Simion reviewed the Student’s and S.Z.’s Task 4 codes. He
found that both students’ code contained identical implementation of the
filters, with only cosmetic changes that Professor Simion suspected had
been made with the intention of thwarting plagiarism detection. Professor
Simion also found that in the ‘apply’ methods of their code, the Student and
S.Z.’s codes handled the exceptions in the exact same order, had the same
order of assertions, had the same variable assignment order, and followed

- 24 the same structure. In Professor Simion’s experience, these similarities
could not have happened by coincidence.
Academic Offence Meetings
65. The Student met with Professor Simion about his CSC148 2022
Assignment 1 on March 2, 2022. The matter was subsequently forwarded
to the UTM Academic Integrity Office. The Student declined to meet with a
Dean’s Designate about this matter, and it was forwarded to the ViceProvost’s Office.
66. K.N., M.O., and S.Z. admitted either to Professor Simion or to the UTM
Academic Integrity Office that they had collaborated with others and/or
obtained unauthorized assistance from online sources to complete
CSC148 2022 Assignment 1.
2. CSC148 2022 Assignment 2
67. CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 was due on April 5, 2022. CSC148 2022
Assignment 2 was called “Huffman tree compression”. The assignment
required students to complete functions that could be used to compress
and decompress a file using the Huffman form of compression. A copy of
the CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 instructions is included in the JBD at Tab
25.
68. On page 2 of the CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 instructions, students
were instructed to read the Plagiarism Acknowledgment (on pages 11 and
12)

carefully.

Students

were

required

to

submit

a

Plagiarism

Acknowledgment as a separate file in their CSC148 2022 Assignment 2
submission. The Plagiarism Acknowledgment stated:
I, ________ [FULL NAME HERE] declare that I have not
committed an Academic Offence on this assignment.
Specifically:
- I have read the Academic Code of Conduct linked in the course
syllabus
- I am aware of what constitutes plagiarism
- No code other than my own (plus starter code) has been
submitted

- 25 - I have not received any pieces of code from others (including test
cases), I have not obtained pieces of code available publicly, nor
modified such code to pass as my own work.
- I have not shared any parts of my code with others (including test
cases), nor shared specific details on how others may reproduce
similar code.
- I did not instruct another classmate on what to write in their
assignment code
- I did not receive instruction on specifically what to write in my
code, and have come up with the solution myself
- I did not look for assignment solutions online
- I did not attend private tutoring sessions (including in other
languages) which are not explicitly sanctioned by UTM where the
assignment was discussed.
- I did not post my own code publicly online on places like Github,
pastebin, etc.
I acknowledge that this declaration is truthful and does not include
any misrepresentation.
I acknowledge that not being able to explain in detail my own work
will result in a zero on this assignment, and that if the code is
detected to be plagiarised, severe academic penalties will be
applied when the case is brought forward to the Dean.
69. Students were also told in the CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 (on page
4) that copying someone else’s code, “even bits and pieces of code,
whether from online sources or from other students”, constituted an
academic offence and would jeopardize their academic status.
70. To complete CSC148 2022 Assignment 2, students were provided with
starter code. Students were also provided with an example of a Huffman
coding tree. A copy of the starter code files provided to students for this
assignment are included in the JBD at Tab 26 (A-D). A copy of the example
Huffman coding tree is included in the JBD at Tab 27.
71. The Student submitted CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 as required,
including the plagiarism acknowledgment. A copy of the Student’s
plagiarism acknowledgment for CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 is included in
the JBD at Tab 28.
72. As part of the grading process, all CSC148 2022 Assignment 2
submissions were run through MOSS.

- 26 73. MOSS detected similarities between the Student’s submission for
CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 and an assignment submitted by another
student in January 2020 (the “Prior Assignment” and the “Prior Assignment
Submission”). The Prior Assignment was a similar, but not identical,
iteration of CSC148 2022 Assignment 2, which had been run in CSC148 in
the Winter 2020 term.
74. MOSS identified similarities between 39% of the Student’s code for
CSC148 2022 Assignment 2 with the Prior Assignment Submission. A copy
of the MOSS report for the Student’s code and the Prior Assignment
Submission and an annotated side-by-side comparison of the Student’s
code and the Prior Assignment Submission are included in the JBD at Tab
29 and Tab 30, respectively.
75. Professor Simion reviewed the Student’s code and the Prior
Assignment code. He found that every function in the Student’s code had
virtually identical implementations to the Prior Assignment Submission,
other than cosmetic changes such as renaming variables or adding extra
spacing. Professor Simion determined that the Student’s code was nearly
identical to the Prior Assignment Submission in all of the functions that the
Student was required to implement, including on sections of the code that
students were required to write themselves from scratch, such as the
“improve_tree” function (as shown in green in lines 431-459 of the
Student’s code and lines 681-714 of the Prior Assignment Submission code
at Tab 30, pages 246 and 250 of the JBD, respectively).
76. Professor Simion found that the progression of the Student’s code was
the same as the progression in the Prior Assignment Submission code. The
only differences between the Student’s code and the Prior Assignment
Submission code that Professor Simion identified were merely cosmetic
changes, such as adding extra spacing and changing variable names,
including replacing “all node” (in the Prior Assignment Submission code)
with “every node” (in the Student’s code). He was of the view that the
similarities he identified could not occur by coincidence.

- 27 77. The Student met with Professor Simion about his CSC148 2022
Assignment 2 on April 21, 2022. The matter was subsequently forwarded
to the UTM Academic Integrity Office. The Student declined to meet with a
Dean’s Designate about this matter, and it was forwarded to the ViceProvost’s Office.

82. The Student acknowledges that he is signing this ASF freely and
voluntarily, knowing of the potential consequences he faces, that he has
been given the opportunity to seek the advice of counsel, and that he has
done so.

5.

In the course of the hearing, counsel for the University reviewed at some length
and in detail the content of the Agreed Statement. The Student was present
throughout this presentation. He did not object to the presentation of the ASF in
any respect. Indeed, he acquiesced in the presentation and its content.

6.

In closing submissions, counsel for the University emphasized that all of the
elements of the offences charged were proven by the content of the Agreed
Statement, and that the Agreed Statement was executed by the Student,
acknowledging that he had been given the opportunity to seek the advice of
counsel and had done so.

7.

The Panel carefully considered all of the submissions made and the contents of
the Agreed Statement. The Panel was particularly influenced by the admissions of
the Student and that the Student had admitted all elements of the offences
charged, as reflected in particular by paragraphs 78-82 of the Agreed Statement.

8.

The Panel registered a finding of guilt and entered convictions on Charges 1, 3, 6
and 10, as sought by the University. In accordance with its undertaking, on the

- 31 return of convictions on Charges 1, 3, 6 and 10, the University withdrew the
remaining alternative charges.
C.

SANCTION / PENALTY

9.

For purposes of the hearing as to penalty, counsel for the University and the
Student jointly submitted a Book of Documents (re: Sanction). This was marked as
Exhibit 2 at the hearing. Included in Exhibit 2 was an Agreed Statement of Facts
on Penalty and Joint Submission on Penalty (the “ASFP/JSP”). The ASFP/JSP
was executed by counsel for the University and by the Student. It set out the
following:
1.

For the purposes of this hearing under the Code of Behaviour on
Academic Matters (the “Code”), the Provost of the University of
Toronto and D

B

(“the Student”) have prepared this

Agreed Statement of Facts on Penalty and Joint Submission on
Penalty (“ASFP/JSP”). The Provost and the Student agree that:
(a) the document attached to the ASFP/JSP may be admitted into
evidence before the Tribunal for all purposes, including for the
truth of the document’s contents, without further need to prove the
document; and
(b) if the document indicates that it was sent or received by someone,
that is prima facie proof that the document was sent and received
as indicated.
A. Agreed Statement of Facts on Penalty
2.

The University of Toronto Mississauga (“UTM”) maintains a database
of allegations of academic misconduct that have been made against
students. There is an academic offence entry or a discipline case
report for each allegation in the database, which records the details
relating to the allegation and the outcome.

- 32 3.

According to UTM’s records, the Student has committed and been
previously sanctioned for academic misconduct in two assignments.
These allegations were treated as concurrent offences.

4.

In Fall 2020, the Student was alleged to have committed the academic
offence of obtaining unauthorized assistance to complete each of
Assignments 2 and 3, collectively worth 18%, in CSC108H5:
Introduction to Computer Programming (“CSC108”).

5.

On March 2, 2021, Jade Hazell, on behalf of Dean’s Designate
Professor Michael Lettieri, sent the Student a letter about the CSC108
allegations. Professor Lettieri’s letter included a resolution offer that
the Student could accept if he forewent a Dean’s meeting with
Professor Lettieri. Professor Lettieri’s letter also stated in part:
[p]lease note that should a subsequent allegation of
misconduct be brought to my attention, it will be taken into
account that this is not your first allegation and the
consequences may be more severe.

6.

The Student admitted to the CSC108 offences on March 14, 2021 via
email. A copy of the Student’s email exchange with Ms. Hazell, which
includes Professor Lettieri’s letter, is included in the ASFP/JSP at Tab
1.

7.

The Student was sanctioned with a mark of zero on both Assignment
2 and Assignment 3 and a 12-month notation on his transcript that
stated “Mark reduced in CSC108H5F, 2020(9) due to academic
misconduct.” The notation was in place from March 19, 2021 to March
19, 2022.

8.

If the Student were to testify, he would state the following:
(a) Beginning in 2017 until around 2021, he was dealing with a difficult
domestic situation that involved heated fights between his
parents, including discussions of divorce, in which the Student had
to act as a mediator between them;

- 33 (b) The issues between his parents affected him and his sister and,
in respect of the Student, made it difficult for him to focus on his
studies, which caused him to receive poor grades and make poor
choices that he now regrets;
(c) He is now a motivated student who is trying to get his life back on
track, both academically and personally. He currently attends
Sheridan College to study Computer Systems Technology –
Software Development and Network Engineering and has
improved his GPA;
(d) He anticipates that he will graduate from Sheridan College in 2026
and intends to apply for a transfer to a partnered university (not
the University of Toronto) once he receives his diploma; and
(e) He is currently employed as a FedEx express delivery driver to
support himself. He also provides financial support to his family.
B. Joint Submission on Penalty
9.

The Provost and the Student submit that, in all the circumstances of
the case, the University Tribunal should impose the following sanctions
on the Student:
(a) A final grade of zero in each of MAT102H5 (Summer 2021),
CSC148H5 (Summer 2021), and CSC148H5 (Winter 2022);
(b) A suspension from the University for a period of 5 years to
commence on May 1, 2023 and end on April 30, 2028; and
(c) A notation of the offence on the Student’s academic record and
transcript for a period of 5 years from the date of the University
Tribunal’s order.

10. The parties agree that this case shall be reported to the Provost for
publication of a notice of the Tribunal’s decision and the sanction
imposed, with the Student’s name withheld.

- 34 C. Acknowledgements
11. The Student acknowledges that the Provost has advised the Student
of their right to obtain legal counsel and that the Student has obtained
that advice, or waived their right to obtain that advice.
12. The Student acknowledges that they are signing this ASFP/JSP freely
and voluntarily, knowing of the potential consequences they face and
knowing that the University Tribunal is not bound by this ASFP/JSP
and has the discretion to impose and/or recommend a different
sanction, including one that is more severe than the ASFP/JSP
recommends.

10.

In her submissions as to penalty, counsel for the University emphasized that the
chronology of offences committed by the Student evidenced recurrent academic
misbehavior beginning as early as 2020 and continuing. She made the submission
that, but for his cooperation with respect to this prosecution, the Student could be
facing a penalty that would include expulsion from the University. The Student did
not dissent from this submission. Rather, in mitigation of his misconduct, he relied
upon his cooperation and difficult personal circumstances that contributed to his
misbehavior, as set out in the ASFP/JSP.

11.

In its deliberations, the Panel reviewed carefully the ASFP/JSP and the
submissions of the parties. The Panel recognized and accepted that, but for his
cooperation, the Student could be facing a penalty that would include expulsion
from the University. The Panel also recognized and accepted that, although under
no obligation to accept the joint submission on penalty, the case law has
repeatedly and consistently emphasized that a hearing panel ought to impose the
sentence agreed upon by the parties in their joint submission, unless to do so
would be fundamentally contrary to the interests of the University community and
objectively unreasonable or unconscionable. In this way, the greater interests of
the discipline process in fairness and efficiency is furthered and the system, as a
whole, benefits.

- 35 12.

The Panel accepts and adopts the guidance and direction of this case law and,
accordingly, is prepared to accept the penalty agreed upon by the parties in the
ASFP/JSP.

13.

In the course of its deliberations, the Panel considered that the joint submission
asked the Panel to accept that the Order sought would include a suspension from
the University for five years, to begin on May 1, 2023, rather than beginning on the
date of the issuance of the Order. The Panel recognized that some case law does
support the “backdating” of the commencement of a suspension, although the bulk
of the case law is to the contrary.

14.

To obtain further context for its deliberations on this matter, the Panel requested
that the parties make submissions as to whether this suspension and any future
academic suspension that the Student would be subject to would run consecutively
or concurrently. The parties did so and jointly provided the Panel with “Written
Submission of the Parties (Re: Suspensions)”, which also addressed backdating.

15.

After considering those Written Submissions carefully, the Panel determined that
any remaining questions it might have about the timing of this suspension would
not satisfy the high bar for rejecting a Joint Submission on Penalty. According, the
Panel confirmed that it was prepared to issue the Order as requested jointly by the
parties.

   The Student was charged with one count of knowingly representing as
   their own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another in a
   problem set, which they submitted in a math course, contrary to section
   B.i.1(d) of the Code. In the alternative, they were also charged with
   one count of knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection
   with that problem set, contrary to section B.i.1(b) of the Code. In the
   further alternative, they were also charged with one count of knowingly
   engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct,
   fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order
   to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in
   connection with the problem set, contrary to section B.i.3(b) of the
   Code.

   The Student was neither present nor represented at the hearing. Given
   the University‚s evidence, the Panel found that the Student had
   received reasonable notice of the hearing and the charges pursuant to
   sections 6 and 7 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act (‚SPPA‚), rules
   9 and 17 of the University Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and Procedure
   (the ‚Rules‚), and the University‚s Policy on Official Correspondence
   with Students . The hearing commenced in the Student‚s absence. On the
   first hearing date, the Panel adjourned the hearing and issued an
   interim order to allow the University the opportunity to provide
   additional evidence regarding the allegations against the Student. The
   matter reconvened on a second date in the Student‚s absence

   In reviewing the Student‚s answer to a question of the problem set, the
   course instructors determined that the Student‚s answer was similar to
   the answer that the instructors had already found on Chegg.com. The
   evidence before the Panel included a side-by-side comparison of the
   Student‚s answer and the answer posted on Chegg.com. Errors in the
   Student‚s answer were similar to errors in the Chegg answers. The
   University argued that those errors were unusual and unlikely to be
   coincidental. The Panel heard evidence that most students who had
   submitted ‚additional Chegg answers‚ had admitted to receiving
   unauthorized assistance. The Panel found the Student guilty of one
   count of knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance, contrary to
   section B.i.1(b) of the Code. It stated that it is not for the Panel to
   imagine if some other possible explanation exists and that it must
   determine if it is more likely than not that the similarities arose
   because of unauthorized assistance. The University withdrew the
   remaining charges.

   With respect to sanction, the Panel considered submissions by the
   University. For example, the University submitted that the Student had
   not provided evidence regarding extenuating circumstances. It also
   argued that plagiarism is a serious offence that strikes at the heart
   of academic integrity, and that the Panel ought to consider the
   commercial nature of Chegg.com as an aggravating factor in penalty. The
   Panel observed that since the Student did not participate in the
   hearing, they had therefore chosen to forgo their opportunity to
   provide evidence on mitigation for penalty. The Panel noted that the
   Student had attempted to withdraw from their courses and observed that
   the outcome might have been different if the Student had participated
   and provided an explanation. The Panel observed that the penalty sought
   by the University was not at the high end of the range, and, in light
   of the surrounding circumstances, appropriately so.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a grade of zero in the
   course; a two-year suspension; a three-year notation on the Student's
   transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication with the
   Student‚s name withheld.

   The Student was charged under s. B.i.1(d) of the‚ØCode of Behaviour on
   Academic Matters, 1995‚Ø(the ‚Code‚) on the basis that the Student
   knowingly represented as her own, an idea or expression of an idea,
   and/or the work of another in an essay, which she submitted in partial
   completion of the requirements of a course. In the alternative, the
   Student was charged under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code on the basis that the
   Student knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or
   misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the
   Code in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of
   any kind in connection with the essay.

   The Panel received an Agreed Statement of Facts (‚ASF‚) which outlined
   that the Student pled guilty to the charges. The University agreed to
   withdraw the alternative charge if the Panel found the Student guilty
   of the first charge. The ASF further outlined that upon submission of
   the essay the teaching assistant and instructor were concerned that the
   Student may have committed plagiarism. The Student met with the
   teaching assistant and instructor at which time the Student admitted
   that she had purchased the essay that she submitted for partial
   completion of the requirements of the course. The Panel noted that in
   the ASF the Student admitted to contacting someone on WeChat who
   advertised that she provided tutoring and essay services for students.
   The Student further admitted that she provided the author with some
   draft ideas for the paper and paid the author $100 for the essay, which
   the author wrote and delivered to the Student. The Student submitted
   the purchased essay for academic credit. The ASF further outlined that
   the Student was very remorseful for her conduct and knew or ought to
   have known that she had committed plagiarism and a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, or fraud. The Panel noted that the
   Student acknowledged that she signed the ASF freely and voluntarily,
   knowing the potential consequences, and did so with the advice of
   counsel or waived the right to counsel. Based on the Student‚s
   admissions, the Panel found the Student guilty of one count of the
   academic offence of plagiarism, contrary to s. B.i.1(d) of the Code.¬
   Given this finding, the University withdrew the charge under s.B.i.3(b)
   of the Code.

   In determining sanction, the Panel heard submissions from the Student
   and the University. The University submitted that plagiarism in the
   form of purchased work was amongst the most serious offences as it
   introduces an economic element, and therefore, is premeditated. The
   University further outlined that the misconduct undermines the
   University‚s reputation and the ability of third parties to rely on
   marks assigned by the University and it disadvantages honest students
   who put forth the effort to submit their own original work. The
   University provided the Panel with twelve cases involving purchased
   essay plagiarism offences to support its requested penalties. The Panel
   noted that these cases establish that the usual penalty for purchasing
   an essay is expulsion with the potential to reduce the penalty to a
   five-year suspension when mitigating factors were present. Furthermore,
   the standard penalty for plagiarism also involves a grade of zero in
   the relevant course. The Panel noted that the University acknowledged
   that the Student immediately admitted her guilt and cooperated through
   the process and that her cooperation was taken into account as a factor
   in not requesting expulsion. However, the University submitted that
   this did not constitute the type of exceptional mitigating
   circumstances that the past decisions indicate is required before a
   suspension of less than five-years is imposed. The University asked the
   Panel to follow the clear line of precedent and start with the
   presumption that expulsion is the appropriate penalty when the offence
   involves purchasing a paper and then take account of the University of
   Toronto v. Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5, 1976) factors to
   determine whether a lesser penalty was appropriate. The University
   identified the nature of the offence, the need for general deterrence,
   the harm to the University and the extenuating factors as the relevant
   factors that supported the requested five-year suspension.

   In her submissions, the Student was apologetic and remorseful. She
   explained that she did not realize she was making a mistake at the time
   she committed the offence but acknowledged that she was doing poorly in
   the course and wanted a better mark. The Student further explained that
   the remote learning was difficult for her and that she suffered from
   anxiety and insomnia as a result of the discipline process. The Student
   spoke to the impact that a long suspension would have on her, her
   education and work prospects. The Student asked the Panel to impose a
   more lenient penalty than the University‚s proposed five-year
   suspension although she did not identify a specific alternative
   penalty. In response to the Student‚s submissions, the University
   pointed out that the Student was able to achieve a strong grade in
   another course that was delivered virtually at the same time as the
   course in question. Furthermore, the University argued that the
   pandemic should not be considered as a mitigating factor as it was a
   common experience for all students.

   Upon review of the past decisions provided by the University, the Panel
   noted that it is clear that expulsion is the appropriate starting point
   for offences involving purchased papers although mitigating factors
   sometimes lead to a reduction, generally to a five-year suspension. The
   Panel further noted that to reduce the suspension to less than
   five-years would require evidence of exceptional mitigating or
   extenuating factors that were not present in this case.

   The Panel accepted the Student‚s evidence that she made a mistake that
   she regretted and would learn from. These factors weighed in favour of
   not recommending that the Student be expelled. However, the seriousness
   of the offence combined with the detriment to the academic integrity of
   the University and the strong need for general deterrence all supported
   the University‚s proposed five-year suspension. The Panel accepted the
   University‚s submissions on penalty and imposed the following
   sanctions: a final grade of zero in the course; a suspension for just
   under five years; a notation on transcript for just under five years;
   and a report to the Provost for publication.

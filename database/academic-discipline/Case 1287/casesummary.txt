   The Student was charged with two counts under s. B.i.1(b) and two
   counts under s. B.ii.1(a) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters,
   2019 (the âCodeâ), on the basis that they knowingly obtained
   unauthorized assistance in connection with a midterm test and final
   exam and knowingly aided and assisted other students to use or possess
   an authorized aid or aids to obtain unauthorized assistance. The
   Student was also charged with two counts under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code
   on the basis that the Student knowingly engaged in a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation in order
   to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage in connection
   with a midterm test and final exam.

   The Student was not in attendance to confirm that they had accepted the
   plea as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts (âASFâ), although his
   counsel, in a brief appearance, noted that the Student would not attend
   since the parties had entered intoÂ  an ASF and a Joint Submission on
   Penalty (âJSPâ). The Panel reviewed the evidence outlined in the ASF
   and noted that the Student wrote the final exam in the course.Â  Upon
   review of the exam answers, the Professor found several similarities in
   the answers on the final exam submitted by Student and other students
   (the âInvolved Studentsâ) in the course. The Professor, on further
   investigation of prior answers submitted by the Student on a midterm
   test, noted further similarities with answers submitted by other
   students, including similar mistakes and non-standard notation. The ASF
   outlined that at a Deanâs Designate meeting, one of the Involved
   Students, C.U.-O, had admitted that they had obtained the Studentâs
   exam answers from a OneNote account which the Student had logged into
   earlier on C.U.-Oâs computer.Â  The ASF further outlined that the
   Student attended an initial meeting with the Deanâs Designate in which
   they denied that they had committed an academic offence but did not
   dispute logging into OneNote on C.U.-Oâs laptop. The Student
   subsequently attended a second meeting with the Deanâs Designate and
   the Professor to discuss allegations that they had collaborated with
   other students during a midterm test. The Student denied that they had
   received unauthorized assistance on the test. Pursuant to the ASF, the
   Student pled guilty to all six charges. The Panel was satisfied that
   the Student agreed to and accepted the ASF and the plea contained in
   it.

   The Panel reviewed the ASF, the documents in support thereof and
   considered the submissions of the Assistant Discipline Counsel and
   counsel for the Student. The Panel found that the evidence strongly
   supported that the Student provided and received unauthorized
   assistance on both the Final Exam and on Test 2. With regard to the
   charge under s. B.i.3(b), the Panel found that the affidavit provided
   by C.U.-O set out in detail the deceit that C.U.-O and the Student had
   engaged in so as to avoid the Student being charged with or held
   responsible for any offences. Accordingly, the University returned a
   finding of guilt with respect to the charges under ss. B.i.1(b),
   B.i.3(b), and B.ii.1(a) of the Code.

   In determining an appropriate sanction, the Panel received, on consent
   of the parties, additional evidence that the Student had previously
   admitted to four prior academic offences related to plagiarism. The
   Student and the University submitted a JSP. The Panel noted that it
   should only depart from a JSP where the proposed sanction is so far
   outside the range of appropriate outcomes that accepting it would bring
   the administration of justice into disrepute.

   The Panel accepted the JSP because it was not contrary to the public
   interest, nor did it bring the administration of justice into
   disrepute. The Panel considered the factors and principles relevant to
   sanction set out in University of Toronto and Mr. C (Case No.
   1976/77-3, November 5, 1976), and noted that the character of the
   Student and the likelihood of the repetition of the offence would
   support the most severe sanction in the absence of the JSP: a
   recommendation that the Student be expelled. The Panel further noted
   that the sole mitigating factor was the fact that the Student
   cooperated and entered into an ASF on both the offence and penalty as
   well as a JSP. The Panel imposed the following sanctions: final grade
   of zero in the course; a five-year suspension; a notation on the
   Studentâs academic record and transcript for six years; and a report to
   the Provost for publication.

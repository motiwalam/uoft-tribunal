c. a suspension from the University of Toronto from the day the Tribunal
makes its order to April 30, 2020;
d. a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript from the
day the Tribunal makes its order until graduation
e. that this case be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the Student’s name
withheld.
10. The Student had accumulated 19.5 credits as of the hearing date. She is just shy of
the 20 credits required to graduate. The Student is originally from China. She
returned to China following the expiry of her study permit on November 30, 2016.
11. The Tribunal accepted the Joint Submission on Penalty with respect to the final
grades of zero, the suspension until April 30, 2020 and the publication of the notice
of the decision. The penalties are all within the reasonable range of sanctions based
upon the precedents submitted by Ms. Lie.
12. The Tribunal also agreed that a notation of the sanction on the Student’s academic
record was reasonable. However, Tribunal members raised concerns regarding the
duration of the notation and the fact that its removal was linked to the Student
graduating from the University.
13. Counsel advised that the Parties’ expectation was that the Student would eventually
return to complete her studies and graduate from the University.
14. Circumstances can change however. The Student is a foreign student and may
decide at some point in the next three years not to return to the University once her
suspension is over. In that case, the Tribunal felt it would be unfair to the Student
for the notation to remain on her academic record indefinitely. From counsel’s
submissions, it was clear that the Parties did not intend that the notation would
remain on the Student’s record indefinitely.

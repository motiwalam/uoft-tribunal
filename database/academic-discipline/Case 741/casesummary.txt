   Grievances
   Wayne Dowler, Deanâs Designate, University of Toronto Scarborough
   Not In Attendance:
   The Student
   Trial Division â s. B.i.1(d) of the Code â misrepresentation and
   plagiarism â Â Student does not appear at department meeting or
   Tribunal hearing â no evidence of insight or remorse â grade of zero in
   course; two year suspension; notation on transcript; report to Provost
   for publication
   Student charged with an offence under s. B.i.1(d) and an offence under
   s. B.i.3(b) of the Code , in the alternative. The charges included the
   Studentâs representation of anotherâs ideas as his own in an essay.
   The Student did not appear at the specified time. The Panel recessed
   for 15 minutes after which it was satisfied it had the jurisdiction to
   proceed. The Panel found the Student had committed the first offence
   and the University withdrew the alternative charge.
   Students in the course in question were required to write an essay
   using at least three secondary sources and turn in both a hard copy and
   one on Turnitin.com, an online plagiarism screener. The Studentâs essay
   was flagged as being 17% similar to an online article and having a 32%
   âglobal similarity indexâ. Further inquiry into the online article
   revealed that the Student had appropriated the articleâs synopsis of
   other works as well.
   The matter was not dealt with at the departmental level as the Student
   was invited to meet with the Dean or his designate but had not
   appeared.
   The University submitted a penalty of a final grade of zero in the
   course, a suspension of two years, and a notation on the Studentâs
   academic record until graduation. While satisfied this was a proper
   sanction the Panel considered if the Student should receive an
   increased penalty due to his failure to attend the meeting. The
   University posited that it is important for the Student to show insight
   and remorse and referred to the criteria set out in Mr. C (November 5,
   1976). The decision set out six criteria to be taken into account when
   deciding an appropriate sanction. The Panel found no evidence in
   relation to mitigation, except that it was theStudentâs first offence.
   Additionally, in The University of Toronto and Ms. K (Case 428, June
   2006) the Panel imposed a two year suspension where the Student refused
   to engage in the disciplinary process.
   The Panel assigned a grade of zero in the course, imposed a suspension
   from the date of the order until February 4, 2016, ordered a notation
   on the Studentâs transcript until the Student graduates, and ordered
   that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

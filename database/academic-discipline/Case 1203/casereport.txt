3.

The Student and Assistant Discipline Counsel, on behalf of the University, were able to
reach an agreement and the hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of
Facts (“ASF”) and Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”).

4.

The Panel reviewed the ASF and the Joint Book of Documents (“JBD”) filed confirming
the facts set out in the ASF before and during the course of the hearing. A summary of
the agreed facts follows.

-6-

Evidence and Findings
5.

The Student has been enrolled in University of Toronto Mississauga (“UTM”) since the
Fall 2014 term. In Winter 2016, the Student was suspended for one year due to a low
cumulative grade point average (“CGPA”). The Student was placed on academic
probation when he returned for the Summer 2017 term. The Student’s status returned to
good standing for the Winter 2018 term.

HIS326Y5
6.

In the Winter 2019 academic term, the Student was enrolled in HIS326Y5S: History of
Women in Canada, 1600-2000 (“HIS326”), taught by Professor Kimberly Main. The
syllabus for HIS326 emphasized the importance of academic integrity and provided
an excerpt from the Code, including that it was an offence to commit plagiarism.

7.

As part of the HIS326 course requirements, students in the course were required to
submit two book reviews. The second book review was worth 15% of the final grade
("HIS326 Book Review"). The instructions for the HIS326 Book Review required
students to include in-text citations or footnotes, with page numbers. Students were
also required to provide a reference list.

8.

The Student submitted his HIS326 Book Review, titled "Mennonite Women in
Canada: A History Review", in which he reviewed Marlene Epp's book Mennonite
Women in Canada: A History, on March 30, 2019 ("Student's HIS326 Book
Review"). A copy of the Student's marked HIS326 Book Review was included in the
JBD.

9.

The Turnitin.com Originality Report for the Student's HIS326 Book Review
indicated a 0% similarity index, with no similarity to any sources. However, a
teaching assistant notified Professor Main about possible plagiarism concerns with
the Student's HIS326 Book Review. The teaching assistant had found the Student's
HIS326 Book Review bore significant similarities to a review by Lara Campbell
titled "Mennonite Women in Canada: A History (review)" ("Campbell Review"),
published by the Canadian Historical Review.

10.

Professor Main reviewed the Student's HIS326 Book Review and identified that, while
it contained significant passages which were virtually identical to words, phrases and
ideas in the Campbell Review, it also contained passages that appeared to have been
copied from other reviews (collectively with the Campbell Review the "HIS326
Sources").

11.

Professor Main found that the Student's plagiarism was extensive, encompassing the
entirety of the Student's HIS326 Book Review. The Student often took phrases from
the HIS326 Sources and either re-ordered the words or used a thesaurus to find
synonyms of the same words. Many of the synonyms chosen by the Student do not
accurately translate the meaning or context of the original words from the HIS326
Sources. The use of these synonyms was successful enough to result in the 0%

-7-

similarity index reported by Turnitin. The JSP included handwritten markups on the
Student's HIS326 Book Review which indicated the passages taken from the various
HIS326 Sources.
12.

There was no reference to any of the HIS326 Sources anywhere in the Student’s
Book Review. There were no footnotes or in-text citations. The Works Cited page
contained a single reference to the Marlene Epp Book, which was the subject of the
Student’s Book Review.

HIS358H5S
13.

In the Summer of 2019, the Student was enrolled in HIS358H5S: Canada Since World
War Two (“HIS358”), taught by Professor Kassandra Luciuk. The HIS358 syllabus
directed students in the course to the Code and asked students to consult it for more
information on academic integrity.

14.

As part of the HIS358 course requirements, students were required to submit a book
review ("HIS358 Book Review"). The HIS358 Book Review was worth 35% of the final
grade in HIS358. The instructions for the HIS358 Book Review included a link to a
document titled "How Not to Plagiarize". Students in the course were also provided
with a handout from "The History Student's Handbook" that included a section on
quotations and referencing. Professor Luciuk reviewed these documents in class and
explained how to successfully integrate existing book reviews into students' own
analyses. Professor Luciuk repeatedly told students in the course that it was better to
over- reference than under-reference and also advised students if they had any doubt
about how to properly cite material, they could email her a draft of their assignments
or visit her during office hours.

15.

The Student submitted his HIS358 Book Review titled, "Spying 101 - Book
Review", reviewing Steve Hewitt's Spying 101: The RCMP's Secret Activities at
Canadian Universities, 1917-1997, on August 14, 2019. The Student's HIS358 Book
Review cited the book that he was reviewing but no other works. A copy of the
Student's HIS358 Book Review was included in the JBD.

16.

The Turnitin Originality Report for the Student's HIS358 Book Review identified a
38% similarity index to other sources in the Turnitin database. This was the highest in
the class. Professor Luciuk identified two reviews (Balkilic Review and Jones
Review) that contained very similar matches, together constituting virtually the entire
text of the Student's HIS358 Book Review.

17.

Professor Luciuk observed that the Student's HIS358 Book Review contained a blend
of the HIS358 Sources, synonyms, different verb tenses, differently ordered words,
and filler language. Professor Luciuk observed that the entirety of the Student's
HIS358 Book Review was structured in this manner – every single sentence
corresponded directly to a sentence in either the two reviews identified by the Balkilic
Review or Jones Review. The paragraphs taken from each of the Balkilic Review and
the Jones Review were blended and interspersed throughout the Student's HIS358

-8-

Book Review. Turnitin did not identify the similarities between the Student's HIS358
Book Review and the Jones Review - Professor Luciuk uncovered these similarities
through her own investigation following Turnitin's identification of the Balkilic
Review.
18.

There was no reference to either of the HIS358 Sources anywhere in the Student's
HIS358 Book Review. There were no citations contained in footnotes within the
Student's HIS358 Book Review. The only in-text citations were from the book that
was the subject matter for the Student's Book Review. The Bibliography included at
the end of the Student's HIS358 Book Review contained only one reference, and it
was to the book being reviewed.

CIN302H5F
19.

In Fall 2019, the Student was enrolled in CIN302H5F: Cinema in the Digital Age
("CIN302"), taught by Professor Matthew Stoddard. The course syllabus for CIN302
included a passage on the importance of maintaining academic integrity. The
syllabus also included examples of potential offences under the Code, including
using someone else's ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement.

20.

Students in CIN302 were required to submit a mid-term essay worth 25% of the final
grade and a final essay worth 35% of the final grade in the course.

A) CIN302 Mid-term Essay
21.

The Student submitted his CIN302 Mid-term Essay titled "Hidden Between the
Frames An analysis of The Prestige" to Turnitin on October 28, 2019 (the "CIN302
Mid-term Essay"). The Turnitin Originality Report for the Student's CIN302 Midterm Essay identified a 49% similarity index to other sources in the Turnitin
database, including an 18% match to internet sources. The Turnitin Originality
Report highlighted entire sentences in the Student's Essay that were found to be
identical to sentences found in other student papers.

22.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the Student's CIN302 Mid-term Essay
included verbatim or nearly verbatim text from a reference cited in an article called
"The video essay as a persuasive genre" by Stefani Buco, Department of English,
Stockholms Universitet, at Appendix D, Video Essay 4, "The Prestige - Hiding in
plain sight (by Nerdwriter 1)" ("Prestige Source").

23.

The Student's Mid-term Essay contained no citations or references of any kind. It was
written in the first person, as if the words and ideas used were those of the Student,
yet these words and ideas appear almost verbatim in the CIN302 Mid- term Essay
Sources, which also used the first person.

B) CIN302 Final Essay
24.

The Student submitted his CIN302 Final Essay titled "Scorsese's Capitalism An
Analysis of the Wolf of Wall Street" to Turnitin on December 7, 2019 (the "CIN302

-9-

Final Essay"). The Turnitin Originality Report for the Student's CIN302 Final Essay
identified a 25% similarity index to other sources in the Turnitin database, including:
i.

24% match to a video on YouTube; and

ii.

Entire sentences that were identical to sentences found in other student papers.

25.

The Student's CIN302 Final Essay was discovered to contain verbatim or nearly
verbatim text, without attribution, from the closed captions in the YouTube video
identified by Turnitin. Synonyms were again used in various places throughout the
Student's CIN302 Final Essay.

26.

The Student admitted that he did no meaningful academic work on any of the four
papers. The Student admitted that he knew or ought to have known that he was
representing the ideas of another author, the expression of the ideas of the author, and
the work of the author as his own in each of these four Papers. The student admitted
that he knew or ought to have known that he was committing plagiarism contrary to
section B.1.1(d) of the Code in respect of each of the four Papers.

27.

The Student advised that the four incidents of plagiarism were isolated incidents and
took place during the worst time of his life. The Student further advised that he had
sought assistance through counselling at the UTM and that he was working on his
citations and to be a better student.

28.

On June 3, 2022, the Student submitted a letter to Professor Heather Boon, ViceProvost, Faculty and Academic Life regarding the misconduct. In the letter, the
Student continued to take responsibility for his actions, and provided further context
regarding the difficulties in his life at the relevant time. The letter closes with the
following paragraph:
I cannot express how truly regretful I am of committing these acts of
plagiarism. I was idiotic, reckless, and lost. The only thing I wish for now is
to put my misdeeds behind me. I would like to finally attain my diploma, but
first I must face the consequences for my actions.

29.

The Student also provided a copy of counselling records from the U of T Health and
Wellness Centre from March 2, 2020.

30.

Following deliberations and based on the admissions made by the Student, the ASF and
the supporting materials, the Panel concluded that charges 1, 3, 7 and 9 had been proven
with clear and convincing evidence on a balance of probabilities, and accepted the guilty
plea of the Student in respect of those charges. The Panel was advised that if it convicted
the Student on those charges, the University would withdraw charges 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10
and those charges were so withdrawn.

Penalty
31.

The Student and University submitted a JSP in support of the following penalty:

- 10 -

a. a final grade of zero in the course HIS326Y5 in Winter 2019;
b. a final grade of zero in the course HIS358H5S in Summer 2019;
c. a final grade of zero in the course CIN302H5F in Fall 2019;
d. a suspension from the University for four years commencing on June 1, 2021,
to May 31, 2025; and
e. a notation of the offence on his academic record and transcript from
November 15, 2022 to May 31, 2026 or his graduation from the University,
whichever occurs first.
32.

The parties also submitted that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of
a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the name of the
Student withheld.

33.

These are serious offences. As the Tribunal stated in The University of Toronto and S.S.
(Case No. 1219, December 9, 2021), “plagiarism diminishes the relationship of trust
between the University and its students, and it undermines the evaluative process
fundamental to the academic setting.” The plagiarism in the Student’s four papers was
not minor or inadvertent, it was very deliberately engaged and represented virtually the
entirety of the work the Student submitted.

34.

The Student’s efforts to change the plagiarized material (be reordering the sentences,
using synonyms, etc.) is of particular concern to the University because these efforts had,
at least partially, their intended effect by going undetected by Turnitin. It is of upmost
importance that the penalty imposed sends a strong message that this type of academic
misconduct will be uncovered and will not be tolerated.

35.

In this case, there were multiple offences committed in three different courses over a
period of time. This factor must be taken very seriously as it demonstrates that there is a
real risk that the Student will reoffend.

36.

While these were serious offences for the reasons outlined above, there are also important
mitigating factors to consider. While this involved multiple offences, the Student has no
prior history of academic misconduct. The Student admitted his guilt and entered into the
ASF and JSP. The Student did not attempt to minimize or justify his conduct. He
accepted responsibility and expressed regret and remorse over his conduct. The offences
were committed when the Student was experiencing a particularly difficult time in his
life. The Student sought out counselling – through his Academic Advisor and from the
Health and Counselling Centre. The Student was able to use these resources to get
himself back on track academically and, by the date of the hearing, had earned enough
credits to graduate. The Student expressed gratitude for his Academic Advisor and the
assistance he provided to the Student.

37.

As the Tribunal has stated in many cases, absent exceptional circumstances, panels are
expected to accept and implement joint submissions on penalty. As set out in the

- 11 -

Discipline Appeals Board decision in The University of Toronto and M. A. (Case No.
837, December 22, 2016), a joint submission on penalty “may be rejected by a panel only
in circumstances where to give effect to it would be contrary to the public interest or
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute” (para 25).
38.

In the Panel’s view, the joint submission in this case is neither contrary to the public
interest, nor would it bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In arriving at this
decision, the Panel took into consideration the nature of the offence, the detriment to the
University occasioned by the offence, the need to deter other students from acting in a
similar manner, the character of the Student, and the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the offence (University of Toronto v. Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3,
November 5, 1976), at p. 15). The penalty proposed falls within the range of penalties
imposed in other similar cases.

39.

In all of the circumstances, and having reviewed the cases provided by the parties in
support of the JSP, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel issued the following Order,
which is hereby confirmed:
a. The Student is guilty of four counts of the academic offence of plagiarism,
contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters;
The following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:
i. a final grade of zero in the course HIS326Y5 in Winter 2019;
ii. a final grade of zero in the course HIS358H5S in Summer 2019;
iii. a final grade of zero in the course CIN302H5F in Fall 2019;
iv. a suspension from the University for four years commencing on June 1, 2021
to May 31, 2025; and
v. a notation of the offence on his academic record and transcript from
November 15, 2022, to May 31, 2026, or his graduation from the University,
whichever occurs first.
vi. that this case be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
Tribunal’s decision and the sanction imposed, with the Student’s name
withheld.

Dated at Toronto this 21st day of February 2023.

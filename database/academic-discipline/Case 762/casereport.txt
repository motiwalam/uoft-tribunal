Preliminary Matters
1.

A hearing of the Trial Division of the University Tribunal was held on August 12,

2014 to consider charges against the Student. The charges are attached as Appendix
"A".

2.

The Student did not attend the hearing although duly served with notice.

3.

The Student executed an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit "1 ") which is

attached as Appendix "B". The Student stated (paragraph 5) that she did not want to
attend the hearing.

4.

The Panel ordered that the hearing proceed in the absence of the Student.

The Facts
5.

The Student admitted to knowingly forging documents in connection with her

application for employment with the Canada Border Services Agency Student
Employment Program. At a time when she was not registered as a full-time student at
the University of Toronto and had no intention to return in the next term, she forged the
section of the application form that was to be completed by the Faculty of Medicine,
including the signature of the Registrar, the seal of the Faculty of Medicine and the
stamp of the University of Toronto.

She also forged a letter on the letterhead of the

Faculty of Medicine and the signature of the Registrar. (See Appendix "B" and Exhibit
"2", Joint Book of Documents.)

3

Finding
6.

The Student's conduct amounted to an extensive and elaborate fraud calculated

to deceive a prospective employer, with the potential effect of depriving a qualified
student of a position of employment. She chose the Faculty of Medicine to give her
additional credibility.

In doing so, she created significant reputational risk to the

University, the general community and the prospective employer, the Canadian Border
Services Agency.
7.

The Panel, after deliberation, was satisfied based on the Agreed Statement of

Facts and the Joint Book of Documents, that there was ample evidence to support the
Student's plea of guilty to the charges. The Panel found the Student guilty of the two
counts of academic misconduct contrary to the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters, as set out in Appendix "A".
Penalty

8.

Counsel for the University requested that the Panel impose the following penalty:
(i)

that the Student be immediately suspended for a period of not more than
five years;

(ii)

that the Tribunal recommend to the President that he recommend to
Governing Council that it expel the Student from the University; and

4
(iii)

that this case be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed with the
name of the Student withheld.

9.

The Panel was provided with several authorities relating to similar offences. In

this particular case, the Panel was cognizant of the fact that there was no prior record of
academic discipline.
10.

The Student's conduct involved multiple and serious forgeries.

There was a

deliberate pattern of conduct designed to perpetrate a significant deception. While the
Student did admit to her conduct, there was no evidence before the Panel of remorse or
prospects for the rehabilitation of the relationship between the Student and the
University - a relationship premised on trust.
11.

The Panel regarded the Student's conduct to fall towards the most serious end of

the spectrum of misconduct. The reputation of the University was put at risk through
this series of fraudulent actions. Such conduct is totally at odds with what is required of
a member of the University community, cannot be tolerated and should be condemned
in the strongest form. Students must know that this type of conduct is unacceptable and
inconsistent with being a student at the University. Third parties must be able to rely on
documents issued by the University. The credibility of the University and its students
must be protected from conduct that is inimical to the reputation of the University and to
the honesty and integrity demanded of its students.
12.

On that basis, the Panel accepted the submissions of counsel for the University

and ordered:

5

(i)

that the Student be immediately suspended for a period of not more than
five years;

(ii)

that the Tribunal recommend to the President that he recommend to
Governing Council that it expel the Student from the University; and

(iii)

that th is case be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed with the
name of the Student withheld.

All of which is ordered on August 12, 2014.

   Grievances
   Trial Division â s. B.i.3(a) of the Code â forged academic record -
   Agreed Statement of Facts - Student not at hearing â forged University
   documents â admission of guilt â finding of guilt â suspension of not
   more than five years; recommendation of expulsion; report to the
   Provost for publication
   A hearing took place and was not attended by the Student. An Agreed
   Statement of Facts (ASF) signed by the Student stated that she did not
   want to attend. The matter proceeded in the Studentâs absence.
   The Student admitted to knowingly forging University documents,
   including signatures and a seal, in an application for employment. At
   the time she was not registered with the University. The Panel found
   the Student guilty of two counts of academic misconduct based on the
   ASF and the Studentâs guilty plea.
   The University sought a suspension of not more than five years, a
   recommendation of expulsion, that the case be reported to the Provost
   for publication as penalty. The University provided like cases and
   noted that the Student had no prior academic offences.
   The Panel noted the severity of the Studentâs conduct and the potential
   harm it may cause to the Universityâs reputation, that it was
   deliberate, and there was no evidence of remorse. The Panel imposed a
   suspension of not more than five years, a recommendation of expulsion,
   and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

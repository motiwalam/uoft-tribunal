   The Student was charged with knowingly having someone impersonate the
   Student at the final exam in MGAB03H3 (the ‚Course‚) contrary to s.
   B.i.1(c) and s. B.ii.2 of the Code. In the alternative, the Student was
   charged under s. B.i.1(b) and s. B.ii.2 of the Code for obtaining
   unauthorized assistance in relation to the final exam in the Course. In
   the further alternative, the Student was charged under s. B.i.3(b) for
   knowingly engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or
   misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the
   Code in order to obtain academic credit or advantage in relation to the
   final exam in the Course.

   The Student attended the hearing and was represented by counsel. The
   Student and Assistant Discipline Counsel tendered an Agreed Statement
   of Facts (‚ASF‚) and a Joint Book of Documents (‚Joint Book‚).
   According to the ASF, the Student has been enrolled at the University
   of Toronto Scarborough Campus since Fall 2019. In the Fall 2020 term,
   the Student was enrolled in the Course. The Course syllabus emphasized
   the importance of academic integrity. Students were informed that
   examinations would be online due to the COVID-19 pandemic and informed
   that receiving help or using answers from someone else was a violation
   of the Code.

   While the exam was in progress, the Course Professor received an email
   from an individual identifying herself as Jennifer. Jennifer informed
   the Professor that she had been paid by a tutoring company to write the
   exam for the Student. Jennifer had the Student‚s login credentials.
   Jennifer explained to the Professor through email correspondence that
   the tutoring company allowed students to pay for exam writing services.
   Jennifer had been engaged to write two final exams for the Student for
   two different courses but ultimately was only engaged to write the
   final exam for the Course in this case.

   In June 2021 the Student met with the Dean‚s Designate over Zoom to
   discuss the allegations of academic misconduct. The Student initially
   stated she had written the exam on her own but later in the meeting
   admitted to having paid someone to write it for her. The Student
   explained she was under pressure from her parents to succeed and was
   concerned about failing the Course. The Student said she had found the
   tutoring company through an online advertisement and did not have
   information about who had been selected to write her exam. The Student
   admitted to committing an academic offence by paying for someone to
   write the exam for her.

   The Panel considered the evidence and found the Student guilty of
   knowingly having someone impersonate the Student at the final exam
   contrary to s. B.i.1(c) and s. B.ii.2 of the Code. The University
   withdrew the alternative charges.

   In determining the sanction, the Panel considered previous cases
   involving paying for someone to impersonate a student. The Panel found
   that the University‚s penalty submission was proportional to prior
   cases. The Student‚s counsel pointed out that the Student was very
   remorseful and had admitted guilt early in the process. The Student‚s
   counsel proposed that the Student should receive a four year rather
   than a five-year suspension due to the Student‚s almost two-year wait
   for a hearing and the stress the wait caused. The Panel rejected the
   Student‚s counsel‚s request because the Student had been continuously
   enrolled in the University and had completed all of the courses
   required to complete her program. The Panel also found that while the
   wait was undoubtedly stressful for the Student, the gravity of the
   offence made the five-year suspension necessary to meet the goals of
   both specific and general deterrence.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a final grade of zero in the
   Course; a suspension from the University for a period of five years
   from the date of the Tribunal‚s order; a corresponding notation on the
   Student‚s transcript until graduation; and a report to the Provost for
   publication.

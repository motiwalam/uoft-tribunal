   Grievances

   Student charged with two offences under s. B.i.1(d) and two under s.
   B.i.1(b) , and in the alternative, two offenses under s. B.i.3(b) of
   the Code . The charges related to alleged misconduct in one course,
   though in separate semesters.

   The first set of charges under s. B.i.1(b) , s. B.i.1(d) , and s.
   B.i.3(b) (Charges 1, 2, and 3), related to allegations that the Student
   purchased and used materials Â from a student previously enrolled in
   the course. The Student submitted a report having copied answers to
   three questions from the purchased report. Â The course syllabus made
   it clear that it was an academic offence to give or receive
   unauthorized aid toward completion of course work.

   The second set of charges under s. B.i.1(b) , s. B.i.1(d) , and s.
   B.i.3(b) (Charges 4, 5, and 6), related to allegations that the Student
   posted a note on a website indicating that her course materials were
   for sale. The Student admits to selling the materials, including
   assignments, reports, tests, the report she purchased, and the report
   she submitted, to two different students enrolled in the course. One
   student plead guilty to academic misconduct in use of the materials to
   complete a report. The second student shared the materials with two
   other students. They all then collaborated in preparation of their
   answers to an experiment, admitting they received unauthorized
   assistance in their academic work.

   The Student pleaded guilty and the matter proceeded by way of an Agreed
   Statement of Facts. The Panel accepted the Studentâs guilty pleas to
   the first charges under s. B.i.1(b) , and s. B.i.1(d) and the
   University withdrew the alternative charge under s. B.i.3(b) . The
   Student also pleaded guilty to the second set of charges under s.
   B.i.1(b) , and s. B.i.1(d) , however, the Tribunal noted that the
   Student had not explicitly pleaded guilty to Charge 5. Discipline
   Council was not aware if the three students implicated with respect to
   Charges 4, 5, and 6, had plagiarized the purchased material, only that
   they pleaded guilty to âuse of unauthorized materials.â The Tribunal
   did not convict on Charge 5 and the University withdrew the second
   alternative charge under s. B.i.3(b) .

   Penalty was contested. The Student had been sanctioned for academic
   misconduct on one prior occasion. The Student had admitted to receiving
   unauthorized assistance from another student in violation of the Code .
   In that instance, the student submitted a letter from a Community
   Safety Case Worker at the University as indication of the Studentâs
   domestic and financial issues. Â The Student submitted that she
   initially purchased the material to prepare for a midterm, noting that
   a student organization sold prior examinations and she did not believe
   it to be improper. On cross-examination she recanted this claim.
   Discipline Council submitted a penalty of a final grade of â0â in the
   course, an immediate 5 year suspension, and recommendation to the
   Governing Council that the Student be expelled. The Student submitted
   the penalty was inappropriate but did not submit an alternative. Panel
   did not find that the prior offence was an aggravating circumstance, as
   the Student had notice the Professor was investigating her, but
   Â penalty for this prior offence had yet to be imposed at the time the
   Student committed the offences at issue before the Tribunal. Therefore
   it did not rise to the level of a prior offence. Panel distinguished
   case from âPurchased Essay Casesâ (PEC) as the Student purchased the
   material with intent to prepare for exams, not with âintention,
   deliberation and knowing deceptionâ characteristic of PEC. However, the
   subsequent sale of course materials and the Studentsâ lack of regard
   for her fellow students and the University, led the Panel to recommend
   expulsion over suspension. The Panel imposed a penalty of a final grade
   of â0â in the course, an immediate suspension of five years, a
   recommendation to the Governing Council that the Student be expelled,
   and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for publication.

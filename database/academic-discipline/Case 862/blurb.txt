B.i.1(b) of the Code – plagiarism and unauthorized aid – Student plagiarized and obtained unauthorized assistance for two essays in the Course – though the Panel made no explicit finding that the second essay was purchased, the evidence clearly showed that it was a custom written essay not written by the Student, and it was therefore reasonable to infer that it was purchased – finding on evidence – finding on guilt – grade assignment of zero in the Course; recommendation of expulsion; permanent notation of the expulsion on the Student’s academic record if the recommendation is accepted; 5-year suspension and notation on the Student’s academic record and transcript pending the Governing Council’s decision on expulsion; case reported to Provost for publication

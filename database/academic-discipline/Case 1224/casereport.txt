OVERVIEW

1.

On March 25, 2022, a Panel of the University Tribunal convened by videoconference to

hear the University of Toronto’s (the “University”) allegations that A

S

(the “Student”)

violated the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (the “Code”).
2.

The Student did not attend the hearing. The Panel found that the Student had notice of the

hearing and the charges pursuant to the Statutory Powers Procedure Act (“SPPA”)1 and The
University Tribunal Rules of Practice and Procedure (the “Rules”). The hearing proceeded in the
Student’s absence.
3.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel found that the Student was guilty of the

misconduct as outlined below. The Panel made the Order as outlined below that included that the
Student be immediately suspended from the University for a period of up to five years from the
date of the Order or until Governing Council makes its decision on expulsion, whichever comes
first. The Panel also recommended to the President of the University that he recommend to the
Governing Council that the Student be expelled from the University.
4.

The Panel made the Order with reasons to follow. These are the reasons.

B.

Particulars
a.

At all material times the Student was a student at the University of Toronto.
Application to School of Graduate Studies

7
b.

On February 14, 2021, the Student requested that Professor Scott Heximer of the
Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto submit a letter of reference
on the Student’s behalf as part of the Student’s application to the University of
Toronto School of Graduate Studies (“SGS”) in the M.Sc. program offered by the
Department of Physiology. In support of the Student’s request, the Student
provided Professor Heximer with a copy of the Student’s resume, which stated that
the Student was on the “University of Toronto Dean’s List” (the “Resume”).

c.

On February 23, 2021, the Student requested that Professor Michelle French of the
Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto submit a letter of reference
on the Student’s behalf as part of the Student’s application to SGS. In support of
the Student’s request, the Student provided Professor French with (a) a copy of a
document that purported to be the Student’s unofficial transcript with the University
of Toronto as of February 21, 2021 (the “Purported Unofficial Transcript”) and (b)
a copy of the Resume.

d.

On or about February 28, 2021, the Student submitted an application to SGS in the
M.Sc. program offered by the Department of Physiology. As part of the Student’s
application, the Student submitted (a) a copy of the Purported Unofficial Transcript
and (B) the Resume.

e.

The Student was not on the University of Toronto Dean’s List. The Resume that
the Student provided to Professor Heximer and Professor French and that the
Student submitted to SGS was forged, altered or falsified. It falsely represented the
Student’s academic record at the University of Toronto.

f.

The Purported Unofficial Transcript that the Student provided to Professor French
and that the Student submitted to SGS was forged, altered or falsified. It falsely
represented the Student’s academic record in a number of ways, including:
(i)

the grades earned in courses that the Student had taken;

(ii)

the Student’s sessional grade point averages;

8
(iii)

the Student’s annual grade point averages;

(iv)

the Student’s cumulative grade point averages; and

(v)

that the Student was a “Dean’s List Scholar” in 2019 Winter and 2020
Winter.

g.

The Student submitted the Resume and the Unofficial Transcript to SGS and to
Professor Heximer and/or Professor French for the purposes of having them rely on
the documents as accurately reflecting the Student’s academic record with the
University of Toronto and for the purposes of obtaining an academic advantage.

h.

The Student submitted the Resume and the Unofficial Transcript to SGS and to
Professor Heximer and/or Professor French knowing that they contained false
information, and that they had been forged, altered or falsified.

i.

On June 15, 2021, the Student sent or caused to be sent an email purportedly from
“Parchment on behalf of the University of Toronto”, from the email address
noreply@parchments.ca, to OzTREKK educational services (“OzTREKK”) (the
“Email”), which included a link to download a document that purported to be the
Student’s official transcript with the University of Toronto dated May 27, 2021 (the
“Purported Official Transcript”).

j.

The Email was forged, altered or falsified. It was not from the University of
Toronto. The Student sent or caused the Email to be sent knowing that it contained
false information and that it had been forged, altered or falsified. The Student did
so as part of an application to another educational institution and for the purposes
of obtaining an academic advantage.

k.

The Purported Official Transcript was forged, altered or falsified. It falsely
represented the Student’s academic record in a number of ways, including:
(i)

the grades earned in courses that the Student had taken;

9

l.

(ii)

the Student’s sessional grade point averages;

(iii)

the Student’s annual grade point averages; and

(iv)

the Student’s cumulative grade point averages.

SERVICE

10.

Section 6 of the SPPA requires reasonable notice of the hearing be provided to the parties.

Rule 9 of the Rules provides for the methods of service of documents, including charges and
notices of hearing. This includes personal service, sending a copy of the document by courier to
the student’s mailing address contained in the Repository of Student Information (“ROSI”), or
sending a copy of the document by email to the email address contained in ROSI.
11.

The University’s Policy on Official Correspondence with Students requires that students

provide the University with their current postal and email address through ROSI. Students are
expected to monitor and retrieve all mail, including emails, on a frequent and consistent basis.
12.

Section 7 of the SPPA and rule 17 of the Rules allow this tribunal to proceed in the absence

of a student where notice has been given. When proceeding in the absence of a student, the

13
University must demonstrate it took reasonable steps to notify the student of the charges and of
the hearing. The University does not need to prove actual notice.
13.

The Student was neither present nor represented.

14.

The University filed evidence regarding service and attempts to contact the Student. That

evidence included:
a.

On July 15, 2021, the Office of the Vice-Provost, Faculty and Academic Life served
the charges in this matter on the Student by email to the email address the Student
provided in ROSI.

b.

On July 16, 2021, Samanthe Huang, an Administrative Assistant with the Appeals,
Discipline and Faculty Grievances Office served the Student with a letter
containing the charges against him. Ms. Huang sent the letter by email to the email
address the Student provided in ROSI.

c.

On September 23, 2021, Tina Lie, Assistant Discipline Counsel, emailed a
disclosure letter, a disclosure brief, and a copy of the University’s Policy on Official
Correspondence with Students to the Student. The email was sent to the email
address the Student provided in ROSI.

d.

On December 3, 2021, Ms. Lie emailed the Student to schedule a hearing date.

e.

Ms. Lie did not receive a response to her December 3, 2021 email. Receiving no
response, Ms. Lie emailed the Student on January 13, 2022 advising the Student
she would request a hearing date be scheduled for March 25, 2022 at 9:45 am.

14
f.

On January 13, 2022, Ms. Huang served the Student with the Notice of Electronic
Hearing for the hearing on March 25, 2022 at 9:45 am. The email was sent to the
email address the Student provided in ROSI.

g.

On March 9, 2022, Ms. Huang served the Student with a Revised Notice of
Electronic Hearing. The only change was to advise that a new Chair would preside
over the Hearing, which was still scheduled for March 25, 2022.

h.

On March 10, 2022, William Webb, co-counsel, emailed the Student copies of the
affidavits on which the University intended to rely at the hearing.

i.

On March 17, 2022, Kimberly Blake, Legal Assistant to Ms. Lie, called the local
phone number that the Student had provided in ROSI. The phone rang a few times
and then a recording stated: “the customer you are calling has a voicemail box that
has not been set up.” Ms. Blake called the number again that same day and one
more time on March 18th and got the same recording.

j.

On March 18, 2022, Ms. Blake called the international number that the Student
provided in ROSI. The call went to a recording in Spanish.

k.

On March 18, 2022, Ms. Lie’s office delivered a package by courier to the address
provided by the Student in ROSI. The courier package contained correspondence
from Ms. Lie and the revised Notice of Electronic Hearing and Charges. Ms. Blake
received confirmation that the package was delivered.

15
15.

None of the emails were returned and there was no bounce back received to any of the

emails. The office of Assistant Discipline Counsel did not receive any communication from the
Student.
16.

The University also filed evidence from Andrew Wagg, an Incident Report Architect at

Information Security, Information Technology Services at the University. Mr. Wagg stated on
March 18, 2022, he checked the portal records to determine the last time someone accessed the
Student’s mail.utoronto.ca email. According to Mr. Wagg, that email was last accessed on March
12, 2022.
17.

The University is not required to provide actual notice. While it is likely that the Student

had actual notice of the hearing, this Panel finds that the University complied with the Rules and
has demonstrated that it took reasonable steps to notify the Student of the charges and of the
hearing.
18.

The University emailed the Student the required documents to the email address in ROSI.

Ms. Blake attempted to call the Student at both the local and international number provided by the
Student in ROSI. The Student is required to check his email account, and it was accessed after the
documents had been delivered and before the hearing.
19.

The University sent a copy of the Charges and the Revised Notice of Electronic Hearing

by courier to the address listed by the Student in ROSI. The package was accepted by someone,
who signed for the package. The name reported is similar to the Student’s name, but it is not the
Student’s name.

16
20.

The University complied with the Rules and the Panel therefore determined it would

proceed to hear the case on its merits in the Student’s absence.
E.

FACTS

21.

The University provided affidavit evidence from:
a.

Professor Michelle French, Department of Physiology at the University;

b.

Professor Scott Heximer, Department of Physiology at the University;

c.

Professor Lu-Yang Wang, Department of Physiology at the University;

d.

Sana Kawar, Manager of the University Transcript Centre, Enrollment Services;
and

e.

Nicholas Rule, Dean’s Designate for Academic Integrity with Student Academic
Integrity, Faculty of Arts and Science, at the University.

22.

Professor Rule also gave oral evidence at the hearing under oath.

23.

Based on this evidence, the Panel made the following factual findings.

Background and Application to the SGS
24.

The Student was enrolled in classes at the University between the Fall 2017 and the Winter

2021 semesters. His highest cumulative GPA was 2.42 in his last semester. At the time of the
hearing, the Student was not enrolled in classes and had not graduated from the University.
25.

In February 2021, the Student applied to the University’s School of Graduate Studies

(“SGS”) in the M. Sc. Program offered by the Department of Physiology. As part of his application,

17
he asked Professor Scott Heximer and Professor Michelle French of the Department of Physiology
at the University to provide reference letters.
26.

At Professor Heximer’s request, the Student provided him with a CV and a personal

statement. According to the CV provided (the “False CV”), the Student was on the “University of
Toronto Dean’s List.”
27.

Dean’s List designation is awarded to students with a GPA of 3.5 or above. As noted above,

the highest GPA achieved by the Student was 2.42. Obviously, the Student was never on the
Dean’s List at the University and his False CV contained a false statement.
28.

At Professor French’s request, the Student provided the same False CV and what purported

to be a copy of the Student’s transcript (the “Purported Transcript”) to assist her in preparing the
letter of reference. In addition to making the false statement about the Dean’s List on the False
CV, with Professor French, the Student added to his deceit because the Purported Transcript also
contained false statements. Professor French teaches JPM300H. The Purported Transcript listed
that class mark as 88. After the Student’s scheme was discovered, Professor French reviewed her
records and discovered that the Student’s mark in JPM300H was actually 77. In addition, the
Purported Transcript indicated that the Student’s cumulative GPA through the Fall of 2020 was
3.55.
29.

Professor French and Professor Heximer, unaware that the False CV and Purported

Transcript contained false statements, relied on these documents and prepared the letters of
recommendation for the Student’s application to the SGS.

18
30.

On February 28, 2021, the Student submitted his application to the SGS. The application

contained a personal statement, the same False CV and Purported Transcript that the Student had
provided to Professor French and Professor Heximer, and the reference letters from Professor
French and Professor Heximer.
31.

It is unclear why the Student provided his (falsified) Purported Transcript because the SGS

obtains transcripts through ROSI. Once the SGS obtained the official transcript from ROSI, the
Student’s plan unravelled. The admissions committee could plainly see that not only was the
Student never on the Dean’s List but he had altered all his letter grades, except one – although for
that class, he still changed the number mark received. In addition, on the Purported Transcript, the
Student had lowered several class averages. There was no evidence as to why this was done but
presumably it was done to make the Student’s (falsified) mark appear even higher than the average.
32.

Professor Wang met with the Student to discuss his application on March 29, 2021 and

then forwarded the matter to Student Academic Integrity at the Faculty of Arts and Science.
OzTREKK Application
33.

OzTREKK is an international education agent that helps Canadians apply to study at

universities in Australia and New Zealand.
34.

When Canadian students submit applications through OzTREKK, they request their

transcripts. Those transcripts are provided to OzTREKK through a third party – Parchment. In the
usual course, OzTREKK receives an email from noreply@parchment.com, which contains a
secure link through which the applicant’s transcript can be downloaded.

19
35.

On June 15, 2021,

the Student sent

an email

from

the

email

address

noreply@parchments.ca to OzTREKK. That email contained, as an attachment, another falsified
version of the Student’s transcript. The key difference between that falsified transcript and the
Purported Transcript provided to Professor French, Professor Heximer and the SGS is that this
falsified transcript contained marks through the Winter 2021 semester. Those marks were not
present in the Purported Transcript because those courses would not yet be complete at the time
the Student submitted the application to the SGS.
36.

As part of its case against the Student, the University researched the registration of the

domain “parchments.ca” (as opposed to the official parchment.com). It discovered that
Parchments.ca is registered to the Student, using the same mailing address and local phone number
listed by the Student in ROSI.
Meeting with the Dean’s Designate
37.

Student Academic Integrity (“SAI”) is responsible for investigating allegations of

academic misconduct and arranging for students who are facing such allegations to meet with the
Dean or Dean’s Designate.
38.

In March 2021, SAI received allegations about the Student’s application to the SGS. These

allegations included that the Student falsified his CV to contain the statement about the Dean’s
List, and that he provided the Purported Transcript to Professor French and the SGS.
39.

In June 2021, the SAI received allegations about the Student’s application through

OzTREKK. These allegations included that the Student sent a false email to OzTREKK and that
he provided a falsified transcript to them.

20
40.

On June 22, 2021, Nicholas Rule, Dean’s Designate, met with the Student about the

allegations. Professor Rule provided oral evidence under oath. He confirmed that he gave the
Student the warning required under the Code. Professor Rule testified that the Student understood
the warning and was given an opportunity to ask questions.
41.

The Student attempted to explain the Purported Transcript. He claimed he submitted the

wrong document by mistake. The Student told Professor Rule that he created the Purported
Transcript in 2020 to show students what an unofficial transcript would look like. He could not
recall the names of the students who asked to see an unofficial transcript.
42.

This explanation is not credible. The Purported Transcript contains marks through 2021,

when it was supposedly created in 2020. In addition, if students wanted to see an unofficial
transcript, the Student could have produced his actual unofficial transcript and not a fake one.
F.

CATEGORIES OF ALLEGATIONS

43.

As outlined above, the Provost agreed that if the Panel made findings of guilt on the

Charges at Issue, the remaining charges would be withdrawn.
44.

The Charges at Issue contain seven separate charges. These seven charges relate to:
a.

Providing the False CV, which claimed the Student was on the Dean’s List, to
Professor Heximer;

b.

Providing the False CV to Professor French;

c.

Providing the Purported Transcript, with falsified marks and class averages, to
Professor French;

21
d.

Providing the False CV to the SGS;

e.

Providing the Purported Transcript to the SGS;

f.

Creating a fake email address through which the Student could provide a further
falsified transcript to OzTREKK; and

g.

Providing a falsified transcript to OzTREKK.

G.

FINDING OF GUILT

45.

Based on the evidence received, the Panel is satisfied, based on clear and convincing

evidence, that the Student committed the offences listed in the Charges at Issue.
46.

There are, in essence, three key documents at issue: the Fake CV, falsified transcripts (this

includes the Purported Transcript sent to Professor French and the SGS and the falsified transcript
provided to OzTREKK), and the fake email sent to OzTREKK.
47.

In providing the Fake CV to the professors and to the SGS, the Panel finds that the Student

knowingly falsified his academic record to claim he was on the Dean’s List. There is no plausible
explanation for claiming he was on the Dean’s List.
48.

In providing the Purported Transcript, the Panel finds that the Student knowingly falsified

his academic record to increase his marks and to increase his marks relative to the class average.
There is no plausible explanation for providing the same falsified transcript to both Professor
French and the SGS and then providing a further falsified transcript to OzTREKK.
49.

In creating the domain Parchments.ca and in sending the fake email to OzTREKK, the

Panel finds that the Student engaged in misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise

22
described in the Code in order to obtain academic advantage. The actions taken to register the
domain and create the fake email are calculated and well thought through. There is no plausible
explanation for these actions.
H.

PENALTY

50.

The University sought the sanctions in the Penalty Ordered, outlined above, which includes

a suspension of up to five years (or until the Student is expelled) and a recommendation that the
President of the University recommend to the Governing Council that the Student be expelled from
the University. This is the most severe penalty the Tribunal can recommend.
51.

Assistant Discipline Counsel submitted that this penalty is in keeping with past decisions

of this Tribunal and appropriately considers the six factors outlined in University of Toronto and
Mr. C. (Case No 77-3, November 5, 1976) which are:

52.

a.

the character of the person charged;

b.

the likelihood of a repetition of the offence;

c.

the nature of the offence committed;

d.

any extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;

e.

the detriment to the University occasioned by the offence; and

f.

the need to deter others from committing a similar offence.

While no evidence was filed on the issue of penalty, Mr. Webb submitted that under the

first three factors, the Student had not responded to any correspondence and had not participated
in the proceedings. He submitted that there was no evidence before the Panel to demonstrate that

23
the Student was willing to accept responsibility for his actions. Similarly, the Student had not
provided any evidence regarding extenuating circumstances. In fact, when confronted with the
offence by the Dean’s Designate, the Student continued the deceit by providing an explanation
that defies belief.
53.

The Student engaged in multiple acts of planned deceit that included lying to his professors

and claiming he was on the Dean’s List and creating not one but two forged transcripts. He
registered a domain and sent a fake email containing one of these forged transcripts. His
coordinated, planned deceit must be condemned in the strongest terms. Imposition of the harshest
penalty available to the Tribunal is appropriate in this circumstance.
54.

This penalty is also in keeping with other cases where students have forged transcripts

including University of Toronto and K.L. (Case No. 979, October 30, 2018) and University of
Toronto and Q.W. (Case No. 963, September 7, 2018). In both of those cases, the Tribunal
recommended expulsion.

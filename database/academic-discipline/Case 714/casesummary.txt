   Grievances

   Student charged with four offences under s. B.i.1(a) , four offences
   under s. B.i.3(a) and in the alternative, four offences under s.
   B.i.3(b) . The charges related to four separate emails sent by the
   Student to four separate professors on the same date, each of which
   allegedly contained false or falsified information. The Student pleaded
   guilty to the charges under s. B.i.1(a) and s. B.i.3(a) and the matter
   proceeded by way of an Agreed Statement of Facts. The emails were sent
   to request each professor act as her graduate supervisor. Each email
   contained the same statement that the Student had been granted
   conditional acceptance to the Pharmacology and Toxicology Graduate
   Program at the University. At the time, the Student had not been
   accepted to the Graduate Program. The Student had been advised that her
   application would be placed on hold pending receipt of her final
   grades. A forged academic transcript was also attached to each email.
   The Panel expressed concern with respect to whether the emails could be
   properly characterized as forged, altered or falsified documents for
   the purposes of s. B.i.1(a) . The Panel observed that although the
   information contained in the emails was fraudulent, the emails
   themselves were not falsified. After deliberation, the University and
   the Student agreed to amend the Agreed Statement of Facts so that the
   student would plead guilty to four offences under s. B.i.3(b) in
   relation to the emails instead of four offences under s. B.i.1(a) . The
   Student would also plead guilty to the four offences under s. B.i.3(a)
   in relation to the academic transcripts as anticipated. The Panel
   accepted the revised guilty plea and the University withdrew the four
   charges under s. B.i.1(a) . The parties presented a Joint Submission on
   Penalty. The Student was in her final year at the University and had
   only one credit remaining in order to graduate. The Student
   acknowledged guilt at the earliest possible opportunity and cooperated
   throughout the disciplinary process. She expressed genuine remorse at
   the hearing. The Student had no prior record of academic misconduct.
   Transcript forgery is at the most serious end of the range of
   sanctions. Considerable planning and deliberation went into the
   falsified academic record in this case. The alteration of marks was not
   insignificant. Falsification of records strikes at the heart of the
   honesty and integrity which is at the core of the academic experience
   and evaluation. The Panel accepted the joint submission, noting that in
   the absence of the mitigating factors, the sanction could very well
   have been expulsion. The Panel imposed a five-year suspension, a
   seven-year notation on the Studentâs transcript, and ordered that the
   case be reported to the Provost for publication. The Panel observed
   that if the suspension took effect from the day of the hearing, the
   Student would in fact be suspended for more than five years because the
   Tribunal was sitting shortly after the commencement of the Winter term.
   Accordingly, the Panel, with the consent of the parties, amended the
   Joint Submission on Penalty to provide that the suspension and
   transcript notation would commence on August 26, 2013, which was the
   date of the Studentâs signature on the Joint Submission on Penalty.

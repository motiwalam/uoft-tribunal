-4AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS
4. The Hearing proceeded based on an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”). The Panel also
received a Joint Book of Documents (“JBD”) that is referred to in the ASF.

The

following is an abridged version of the ASF.
A.

MAT224

5. In Winter 2021, the Student enrolled in MAT224, which was taught by several
instructors. Students in MAT224 were evaluated on the basis of, among other things, two
term tests worth a combined 40% (with the highest score worth 25% and the lowest score
worth 15%) and a final assessment worth 25% of their final grades.
6. Term Test 1 (“TT1”) was released on February 12, 2021, and students had until February
13, 2021, to submit their answers. TT1 was administered remotely. TT1 required
students to sign an academic integrity statement, which stated:
I confirm that:
• I have not communicated with any person about the test other than a MAT224
teaching team member.
• I have not used any resources other than those that are listed as permitted in the
Term Test 1 Information document at any point during the test.
• I have not participated in or enabled any MAT224 group chat during the test.
• I have not viewed the answers, solutions, term work, or notes of anyone.
• I have read and followed all of the rules described in the Term Test 1
Information document.
• I understand the consequences of violating the University’s academic integrity
policies as outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. I have not
violated any of them while writing this assessment.
By signing this document, I agree that all of the statements above are true.

7. On February 13, 2021, the Student submitted his answers to TT1, and signed the
academic integrity statement.
8. Chegg.com is a subscription-based website that allows students to post problems to the
site (“Askers”), which are then answered by so-called “experts”. Subscribers are also able
to access the questions and answers posted by others on the site (“Viewers”). The
webpage advertises that a “Chegg Study” subscription costs $18.95/month and will allow

-5subscribers to “[t]ake a photo of your question and get an answer in as little as 30 mins”
from an “expert”.
9. When the instructors reviewed TT1, they found that virtually the entire test had answers
that were similar to solutions that had been posted on Chegg.com. In particular, the
instructors found that there were substantial similarities between the Student’s answers to
Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5(a), 5(b), 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) and answers that had been posted on
Chegg.com.
10. Term Test 2 (“TT2”) was released on March 26, 2021, and students had until March 27,
2021, to submit their answers. TT2 was administered remotely. Students were allowed
to consult their lecture notes, textbook and course materials, but were required to
complete the assessment independently. Students were not permitted to collaborate with
one another or to consult online discussion groups or forums. The instructions for TT2
included examples of resources that are not permitted, including posting on “tutoring
websites” such as Chegg.com.
11. On March 27, 2021, the Student submitted his answers to TT2, and signed the academic
integrity statement. When the instructors reviewed TT2, they found that the test had
answers that were similar to solutions that had been posted on Chegg.com. In particular,
the instructors found that there were substantial similarities between the Student’s
answers to Questions 3 and 7(b) and answers that had been posted on Chegg.com.
12. The Final Assessment was released on April 21, 2021, and students had until April 22,
2021, to submit their answers. The Final Assessment was administered remotely.
13. Students were allowed to consult their lecture notes, textbook and course materials, but
were required to complete the assessment independently. The instructions for the Final
Assessment included examples of resources that are not permitted, including posting on
“tutoring websites” such as Chegg.com.
14. The Final Assessment required students to sign an academic integrity statement. On
April 22, 2021, the Student submitted his answers to the Final Assessment, and signed
the academic integrity statement.

-615. When the instructor reviewed the Final Assessment, they found that the test had answers
that were nearly identical to solutions that had been posted on Chegg.com. In particular,
the instructors found that there were substantial similarities between the Student’s
answers to Questions 3, 4, 5, 6(a), 7 and 8 and answers that had been posted on
Chegg.com.
16. In all three assessments (TT1, TT2, and the Final Assessment), there were a number of
ways the students could answer the questions. The fact that the Student’s answers and
the Chegg.com answers contained the same steps (and omitted the same steps), the
instructors considered it unlikely that the similarities between the Student’s answers and
the Chegg.com answers arose by coincidence.
B.

PHL245

17. In Fall 2021, the Student enrolled in PHL245H1F (Modern Symbolic Logic)
(“PHL245”), which was taught by Professor Alex Koo.
18. Students in PHL245 were evaluated on the basis of, among other things, a final exam
worth 25% of their final grades. On December 15, 2021, the Student wrote the final exam
in the Course. Students were required to complete the final exam independently. The
final exam was administered remotely. Students were allowed to consult their notes and
use Logic2010. Students were not permitted to consult any other resources.
19. Each question on the final exam had two versions which used different variants. Students
were not told that there were different versions for each question.

In grading the

Student’s final exam, the instructor determined that the Student’s answer to Question 11
of the final exam contained the variant used in the alternate version of the question
(which the Student did not receive).
C.

Meeting with the Dean’s Designate

20. On August 17, 2022, the Student met with Professor Sue Varmuza, Dean’s Designate for
Academic Integrity. During the meeting, the Student admitted to using Chegg.com in
TT1, TT2 and the Final Assessment in MAT224, and that he discussed the questions with
other students in the final exam in PHL245.

-721. The matter was forwarded to the Vice-Provost’s office.
D.

Admissions and acknowledgements

22. The Student admitted that:
a. he knowingly accessed Chegg.com during MAT224, and in doing so:
i. he paid for a Chegg.com subscription;
ii. he viewed answers that had been posted to Chegg.com;
iii. he used the answers that had been posted to Chegg.com in his answers to
various questions in TT1, TT2 and the Final Assessment;
b. he knowingly obtained unauthorized assistance in TT1, TT2 and the Final
Assessment in MAT224;
c. he knowingly represented as his own an idea or expression of an idea or work of
another (the authors of the Chegg.com answer) in TT1, TT2 and the Final
Assessment in MAT224; and
d. he committed plagiarism in TT1, TT2 and the Final Assessment in MAT224.
23. The Student further admitted that:
a. he knowingly obtained unauthorized assistance in connection with the final exam
in PHL245 by discussing the questions with other students who had received an
alternate version of Question 11 of the final exam; and
b. he knowingly used an unauthorized aid during the final exam in PHL245.

-8FINDINGS ON CHARGES
24. Following deliberations and based on the ASF and the JBD, the Panel concluded that
charges #1, #4, #7 and #10 were proven on a balance of probabilities. The Panel
accepted the guilty pleas of the Student in respect of these charges.
25. The Panel was advised that if it returns a conviction on the above charges, the University
will withdraw the alternative charges. Accordingly, the Panel makes no findings with
respect to the alternative charges #2, #3, #5, #6, #8, #9 and #11.
PENALTY
26. The University and the Student submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”)
recommending the following penalty:
a. a final grade of zero in the course MAT224H1 in Winter 2021;
b. a final grade of zero in the course PHL245H1 in Fall 2021;
c. the Student will be suspended from the University of Toronto for a period of 5
years, commencing on September 1, 2022, and ending on August 31, 2027; and
d. this sanction will be recorded on the Student’s academic record and transcript
from the date of the Tribunal’s order until graduation.
27. The parties agree that it is appropriate for this case to be reported to the Provost for
publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed in the
University of Toronto newspapers, with the name of the Student withheld.
28. Assistant Discipline Counsel provided submissions on the high threshold required for a
Tribunal to deviate from a JSP. As set out in the Discipline Appeals Board decision in
The University of Toronto and S.F. (Case No. 690, October 20, 2014), only truly
unreasonable or “unconscionable” joint submissions should be rejected (para. 22).
29. The Panel also heard submissions regarding the appropriateness of the penalty, reviewed
relevant past decisions of the Tribunal submitted by the University, and considered the

-9factors set out in University of Toronto and Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5,
1976), namely: 1) the character of person charged; 2) the likelihood of repetition of the
offence; 3) the nature of offence committed; 4) any extenuating circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offence; 5) detriment to the University occasioned by
the offence; and 6) the need to deter others from committing a similar offence.
30. With respect to his character, the University noted that the Student admitted guilt very
early on in the process at the Dean’s Designate meeting. He had insight into his actions
and expressed remorse. He participated and cooperated fully in the process, including
participating in the ASF and ASF on Penalty. As a result, there was a lot of evidence that
the Provost was not required to call. The Student also gave an undertaking to complete
six mutually agreeable academic success workshops offered by the University,
comprising of at least six hours of instruction, or a similar program selected by the
University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science. The Student also agreed that he will
not be permitted to graduate from the University of Toronto until he has completed this
requirement.
31. The Panel also took into consideration the likelihood of repetition of the offence, the
serious and deliberate nature of the offence, and the detriment to the University. This
was not the Student’s first offence. The Student had committed four prior academic
offences, which now brought him to eight academic offences.

However, Assistant

Discipline Counsel noted that all the incidents occurred around the same time from
December 2020 to early 2021; and only one occurred after the first offence in MAT224.
32. The University stressed the seriousness of obtaining unauthorized assistance, particularly
at the height of the pandemic when the University was dealing with remote assessments,
and the fact that online learning provided more opportunity to cheat. The University also
stressed the need to send a strong message of deterrence in order to communicate the
seriousness of these offences.
33. Having regard to the above, and based on the review of similar cases provided by
Assistant Discipline Counsel, in the Panel’s view, the joint submission in this case is
reasonable. The Panel agrees that the recommended sanctions are appropriate.

- 10 DECISION OF THE PANEL
34. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel made the following order:
a. THAT the Student is guilty of four counts of knowingly obtaining unauthorized
assistance in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any
other form of academic work, contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code;
b. THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:
i. a final grade of zero in the course MAT224H1 in Winter 2021;
ii. a final grade of zero in the course PHL245H1 in Fall 2021;
iii. the Student will be suspended from the University of Toronto for a period
of 5 years, commencing on September 1, 2022, and ending on August 31,
2027; and
iv. this sanction will be recorded on the Student’s academic record and
transcript from the date of the Tribunal’s order until graduation; and
c. THAT this case be reported to the Provost, with the Student’s name withheld, for
publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed.
35. An Order was signed after the hearing on April 13, 2023, by the Panel to this effect.
DATED at Toronto, 12 July 2023.

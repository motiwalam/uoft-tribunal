B.1.3(b) of the Code.
Plea:

8.

The Student attended the hearing on June 27, 2013 and entered a plea of guilty
to all six charges listed above.

Counsel for the University indicated that if a

finding of guilt were entered with respect to the charges in paragraphs 2, 4 and 6

-

-------------~-----~----------~

-4-

above, the University would withdraw the charges in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7
above.
9.

The Student's plea of guilty was accepted by the Tribunal.

Agreed Statement of Facts and Finding on Charges:
10.

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the University had
entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts with the Student.

The Agreed

Statement of Facts was marked as Exhibit 1 at the Hearing and is attached as
Appendix A to this Decision.

The Tribunal also received into evidence, on

consent, a Joint Book of Documents, which was marked as Exhibit 2 at the
Hearing.
11.

As set out in more detail in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the circumstances
giving rise to the charges involved multiple occasions on which the Student
submitted an essay as part of his required work for completion of the course in
question, which essay was plagiarized from the work of another person. This
occurred in three different courses, summarized briefly as follows:
(a)

In December 2012, the Student submitted an essay in partial completion
of the requirements for a course in which he was enrolled, International
Trade Regulation.

Except for some minor wording changes, the essay

submitted by the Student was identical to the essay submitted by another
student in the previous academic year. As set out in paragraph 14 of the
Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student admitted his plagiarism.

-5-

(b)

In December 2012, in partial completion of the requirements of a course in
which he was enrolled, Environmental Law, the Student submitted a
paper. This paper, except for some minor wording changes and certain
omissions, was identical to a thesis submitted by another student. As set
out at paragraph 19 of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student
admitted his plagiarism.

(c)

In December 2012, in partial completion of the requirements for a course
in which he was enrolled, Sports Law, the Student submitted an essay.
That essay, except for the introduction, the conclusion, some minor
wording changes and certain omissions, was identical to an article
published in a publicly available journal. As set out at paragraph 23 of the
Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student admitted his plagiarism.

12.

After reviewing the facts contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the
Joint

Book

of

Documents,

including

the

Student's

admissions

and

acknowledgments contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Tribunal
deliberated and concluded that the facts demonstrated that the charges to which
the Student had entered a plea of guilty were proven. The Tribunal agreed to
accept the guilty pleas. A finding of guilt was entered on Charges as listed in
paragraphs 2, 4 and 6 above. Counsel for the University withdrew the Charges
listed in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 above.

-6-

Adjournment:

13.

After the findings of guilt were entered, the Student requested that the Tribunal
grant him an adjournment of the penalty phase of the Hearing, so as to enable
the Student to retain counsel and to prepare for the sanction phase of the
Hearing. Counsel for the University indicated that he was prepared to consent to
the Student's adjournment request on certain conditions, to which the Student
agreed.

14.

After deliberating upon the request, the Tribunal granted the Student's request
and adjourned the Hearing. In so doing, the Tribunal indicated to the Student
that it was granting him a considerable indulgence in order to allow him to
prepare for the penalty phase of his Hearing and the Tribunal urged the Student
to take advantage of the granted adjournment.

15.

The Hearing was subsequently scheduled to continue on September 23, 2013.

16.

The adjournment of the Hearing and the conditions on which the adjournment
was granted to the Student were confirmed by letter from the University to the
Student dated July 4, 2013, which was subsequently marked as Exhibit 3 at the
Hearing.

The date of September 23, 2013 was confirmed by email to the

Student, which email was marked as Exhibit 4 at the resumed Hearing.

Penalty:

17.

As scheduled, the penalty phase of the Hearing proceeded on September 23,
2013. Despite the conditions on which his request for adjournment was granted,
and despite subsequent communications from the University to the Student at his

-7-

acknowledged residence address and email address, the Student failed to
appear.
18.

After deliberation, being satisfied that the University had taken all requisite steps
to communicate with the Student with respect to the continued Hearing, the
Tribunal decided that it was appropriate to proceed with the penalty phase of the
Hearing in the absence of the Student.

19.

Counsel for the University filed a Book of Documents on Sanction, which was
received by the Tribunal. Documents from the Book of Documents on Sanction
were marked as Exhibits 3 and 4, confirming communication by the University
with the Student for purposes of the penalty phase of the Hearing.

20.

Affidavits contained in the Book of Documents on Sanction were marked as
Exhibits 5, 6 and 7 in the course of the penalty phase of the Hearing.

21.

Counsel for the University indicated that the University was seeking, as penalty,
that a final grade of zero be recorded in each of the three courses in question;
that the Student be suspended from the University for a period no greater than
five years; and that the Tribunal recommend to the President of the University
that he recommend to Governing Council that the Student be expelled from the
University.

22.

In support of the requested penalty, counsel for the University, in oral
submissions, referred to evidence filed of several additional instances in which
the Student misled or concealed the truth in connection with career-related job

-8-

applications, or in connection with other instances of communication with the
University. In addition, it was noted that the Student sought an adjournment of
the Hearing in order to retain counsel and prepare for the sanction phase of the
Hearing, where after the Student ceased communications with the University,
failed to respond to communications from the University, and breached the
conditions on which his requested adjournment was granted.
23.

In addition, in an application for summer employment with the -

law firm,

the Student failed to disclose his admitted plagiarism in three courses at the
University, even though this summer employment took place during the summer
of 2013, i.e. , after the Student had entered pleas of guilty and been found guilty
on three of the Charges, particularized above.
24.

Other instances of misleading and untruthful conduct are contained in the
Affidavit of Sara Faherty, Exhibit 6 at the Hearing.

25.

Counsel for the University submitted that there was a likelihood that the Student
would engage in similar offences if allowed to return as a Student at the
University.

He noted that there was no evidence from the Student as to

mitigation; rather, in each of the three courses in question, his acts of plagiarism
were apparently deliberate and ca lculated.
26.

Counsel for the University emphasized that the requested penalty ought to be
granted in order to reflect the principle of general deterrence, i.e., to demonstrate
that blatant acts of plagiarism can result in the most serious penalty.

-9-

27.

The Tribunal considered all of the evidence in the context of the factors that
govern its decision, and considered the authorities contained in the Book of
Authorities provided by counsel for the University.

28.

The proven charges are very serious, particularly the Student's knowing,
acknowledged, and admitted plagiarism in three different courses. The Tribunal
further noted the failure of the Student to attend for the penalty phase of the
Hearing, the Student's breaches of the conditions on which his requested
adjournment was granted, the Student's failure to mitigate his conduct at all, and
the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the penalty for such serious
and deliberate offences.

29.

The Tribunal, therefore, accepted the submissions of counsel for the University
with respect to Penalty.

Decision of the Tribunal:

30.

The Tribunal issued the following Order:
1.

Mr. ~ is found guilty of three counts of the academic offence of

plagiarism, contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters;

2.

The sanction phase of the hearing may proceed in the absence of Mr.

~ ' who received reasonable notice of the continuation of the hearing;
3.

The following sanctions shall be imposed on Mr. ~

:

- 10 -

(a)

he shall receive a fina l grade of zero in each of the course LAW 285, LAW

239 and LAW 256;
(b)

he be suspended from the University commencing June 27, 2013, for a

period not to exceed 5 years;
4.

The Tribunal recommends to the President of the University that he

recommend to the Governing Council that Mr. ~ be expelled from the
University;
5.

This case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the

decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction imposed, with the name of
the student withheld.

uncovered a serious issue of plagiarism in Mr. ~ ITR Essay. The next day, Prof.
Trebilcock advised that he had concluded that Mr.

Blllllllls paper contained "rampant copying"

from a paper submitted the year before by a student named Y.S. A copy of the e-mail chain

In the previous academic year, which was 2011-2012, a student named Y.S. had taken

ITR. He had submitted an essay titled Precedential Value, Trade Strategy, and Forum Shopping

The meetings with the Dean's Designate

24.

On January 22, 2013, Prof. Lee invited Mr. ~ to discuss Prof. Trebilcock's concerns

that Mr. ~ had committed plagiarism in the ITR Essay. A copy of Prof. Lee's letter is

On January 22, 2013, Mr. ~

met with Prof. Lee and Sara Faherty, an Assistant Dean

at the Faculty of Law, Mr. ~ admits that Prof. Lee provided the warning that was required to
be given to him under the Code.
26.

Mr. ~ stated that Prof. Trebilcock's concerns arose from a misunderstanding. Mr.

unintentionally, handed in Y.S.'s paper instead of his own. He explained that Y.S.'s paper had
been given to him by a friend, Steve Hurst, who had dropped out of Osgoode Hall Law School.
Mr. ~ stated that while he had used Y.S.'s paper as a jumping off point, he had written his
own paper.
Prof. Lee invited Mr. ~ to return on January 24 along with any corroborating

evidence that would support his version of events.
28.

On January 24, 2013, Mr. ~ met again with Prof. Lee and Assistant Dean Faherty.

Mr. ~ admits that Prof. Lee provided the warning that was required to be given to him under
the Code. Prof. Lee handed Mr. ~ a copy of a letter dated January 24, 2013, which
indicated that Prof. Lee was also investigating Prof. Green's concerns regarding the paper
submitted in Environmental Law. Prof. Lee indicated that Prof. Green believed that Mr. ~
paper had been copied from M.L.'s thesis.
29.

Prof. Lee asked Mr. ~ if he wanted to revise anything that he had said on January

22. Mr. ~ stated that he had, in fact, intentionally handed in a modified version of the Y.S.
Essay and that it did not happen by accident. He said that he knew what he was doing and he
910414_2

7

had handed in a slightly altered version of the Y.S. Essay because he was not happy with the
quality of his own work.
30.

Mr. ~ then indicated that he had done "the same thing" in Environmental Law.

31 .

Prof. Lee asked Mr. ~ if there was anything he wanted to tell them about Sports

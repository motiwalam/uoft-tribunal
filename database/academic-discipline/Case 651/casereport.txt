[ 1]

Pursuant to the Code of Behaviour on A cademic Matters, 1995 ("the
Code"),
I.

0-11111 ~ ("the student") was charged with:

On or about June 14, 2011, you knowingly represented as your

own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another in connection
with an essay titled "Assignment 2" which you submitted for academic
credit in PHL340H5 ("Essay"), contrary to section B.1.1.(d) of the Code.
2.

In the alternative, on or about June 14, 2011, you knowingly

engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code, in connection
with the Essay which you submitted for academic credit in PHL340H5,
contrary to section B.1.3.(b) of the Code.
[2]

The parties proposed that the matter be disposed of by way of an Agreed
Statement of Facts ("the ASF'') and a joint submission as to penalty. In
the result, Mr. ~ agreed to enter a plea of guilty to Charge 1; the
University agreed to withdraw Charge 2.

[3]

It is not necessary to review the ASF in great detail given the broad

agreement reached between the pm1ies. Mr. ~ agreed that he had
first registered at the University of Toronto at Mississauga in the Fall term
of 2003. He has to date earned 23.0 credits and a cumulative grade point
average of 1.89. As will be reviewed below, he has had a number of prior
brushes with the academic discipline system at the University.

The

Agreed Statement of Facts is attached to these reasons as Schedule A.

2

[4]

In ove1view, Mr. ~ submitted an essay as Assignment 2 in a
philosophy course, PHL340H5.

He also submitted the essay to an

authenticity verification program, Turnitin.com, as the course instructor
required. Turnitin.com produced an "originality report" which indicated

an 18% overall similarity index, with 12% of the similarity being an
internet source: www.iep.utm.edu ("the IEP website").
[5]

A comparison of the essay with the IEP website indicated that numerous
ideas and phrases were produced verbatim or nearly verbatim from the
internet source. Further, a Google search revealed that cettain pluases and
ideas were copied from an internet website, namely, a Wikipedia site on
functionalism ("Philosophy of Mind").

[6]

M r . ~ met with the course instructors on June 24, 2011 to discuss
their concerns with the essay. On June 26, 2011 Mr. ~ sent an
email to instructor Kevin Connolly with a copy to the instructor, Adrian
Prettyman, asking if it was still possible to submit his paper on
Turnitin.com, and attaching another paper with the following explanation:
"Attached is the paper that I attempted to submit to
Adrienne on the 161\ only to realize after I submitted the
draft I use to take notes to understand the topic, which
explains the lack of references, and disjointed
paragraphs/ style ... I submitted the wrong draft due to
clouded judgement from a personal crisis ... "

[7]

Mr. ~ subsequently admitted at the meeting with the Dean's
Designate for Academic Integrity on September 14, 2011 that the Essay
3

was plagiarised. In the formal admissions and acknowledgements in the
Agreed Statement of Facts, Mr. ~ admitted that he had
knowingly:

[8]

(a)

represented in the Essay the ideas of another person, and the work
of another person as his own; and

(b)

commined plagiarism in the Essay contrary to s. B.1.1 (d) of the
Code.

The Tribunal consequently accepted the plea to Charge 1, and agreed to
the dismissal of Charge 2.

Penalty

[9]

The parties also agreed on a proposed penalty, namely that the following
sanctions be imposed:

(10]

(a)

A final grade of 0 in PHL40H5 in the 2011 Summer term;

(b)

A suspension from the University to commence April 10, 2012,
and to end April 9, 2015.

Part of the resolution requires that Mr. ~ also unde11ook to
complete a course of workshops through the St. George Campus College
Writing Centre's Academic Skills Workshops ("the Undertaking"). This

will require him to take six workshops comprising six hours of instruction:
1.

Understanding the assignment

2.

Library research

4

[11]

3.

Thesis statements

4.

Organizing an essay

5.

Using sources

6.

Revising the essay

M r . ~ will not be eligible to graduate from the University until he
fulfills the undertaking. The University may rely on the undertaking to
deny him the ability to graduate until it is fulfilled.

[12]

Further additional facts were submitted in support of the joint submission
on penalty. The Agreed Statement of Additional Facts for Sanction is
attached as Schedule B to these reasons. The Agreed Statement of Facts
dealt with two other instances in which Mr. ~ had admitted
plagiarism:

(a)

First Instance of Plagiarism - PHL341H5-April 2006

[1 3]

In April 2006 Mr. ~ submitted an essay for academic credit in
PHL341H5 wo1ih 40% of the final grade. This essay was taken almost in
its entirety from an internet source. Mr. ~ admitted at a Dean's
meeting that he commit1ed plagiarism in the PHL34 l essay contrary to
section B.I.l (d) of the Code. He explained that his mother had been in a
serious car accident in 2003 for which she received ongoing care from
fami ly members, including him.

The Dean's Designate imposed a

sanction of a reduction by 80% of his final mark in PHL341H5 .

5

(b)

Second Instance of Plagiarism - PHL315H5- June 2008

[14]

On June 24, 2008, M r . ~ submitted an essay for academic credit
in PHL315H5F worth 50% of the final grade. Much of this essay was
taken from internet sources, with the use of paraphrasing and synonyms.
Mr. ~ subsequently claimed that he had submitted this essay in
en·or as a draft. He then sought to submit a revised essay on July 27, 2008.
The revised essay was itself plagiarised and contained concocted
footnotes.

(15]

Mr. ~ once again admitted at a Dean's meeting that he had
committed the offence of plagiarism in the PHL3 l 5HSF June 24th essay
and in the subsequent essay submitted on July 271h contrary to s. B.l.l(d)
of the Code. He explained that this time he had been involved in two car
accidents, one in March 2007 and one in October 2007. The Dean's
Designate imposed a sanction of a final grade of O in PHL3 l 5H5F,
together with a suspension from attending the University for 12 months
from September I, 2009 to August 31, 2010, together with an annotation
on his transcript from 24 months from June 18, 2009 to June 17, 2011.

(c)

The Present Instance of Plagiarism - PHL340H5 - June 2011

[16]

At the Dean's meeting to discuss the offence which brings M r . ~
before the Tribunal on this instance, Mr. ~ furnished a letter from
a physician, Dr. Ajisafe, dated September 12, 2011. The letter described
that Mr. ~ began to exhibit symptoms of panic attacks in 2009

6

following a traumatic (but otherwise undescribed) experience which he
had suffered in the United Kingdom. Somewhat unusually, Dr. Ajisafe
quoted the diagnosis of a unJlamed psychiatrist who was said to have
diagnosed Mr. ~ as follows:
DSM/IV/fR Diagnosis:
Axis l: Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Axis 4: Economic Problems
Axis 5: GAF functioning between 50% to 80%

[17]

Dr. Ajisafe went on to observe the following:
The Psychiatrist has assessed that the psychosocial
stressor which impacted Mr. ~ tends to pmduce
confusion, memory loss and lower concentration,
reducing t'ecall and impairing the ability to relate one
item to another. The Psychiatrist also acknowledged that
i~~rpetual condition, that mainly occurs to Mr.
t9111111111 when under significant anxiety, and panic
attacks.

[ 18)

The physician suggested that given the patient's recent psychiatric history,
and his current medical, "he is can [sic] sometimes behave differently and
this may be the cause of his academic misconduct." He then shared some
views concerning sanction:
Mr. ~ has expressed profound guilt for the
misconduct. He continues to take measures to address
his condition by continuously taking positive steps such
as cognitive behavioural therapy sessions with a
Psychiatrist. However, both the Psychiatrist, and myself,
are concerned that derailing Mr. ~ from
graduating will significantly exacerbate his symptoms
and worsen his illness.

7

[ 19]

Ms. Harmer, counsel for the University, advised that she had accepted the
submission of this medical report given that the matter was otherwise
resolved. Quite understandably, she had taken no steps to determine the
authenticity of the report, nor to seek the underlying clinical notes and
records. The University did not rely upon the diagnosis contained in the
report and we take it from Ms. Harme1·"s submissions that she regarded
Dr. Ajisafe's report with some skepticism.

Discussion
[20]

As members of the University Tribunal, we are frequently in the position
of receiving joint submissions with respect to penalty. This is a good
thing.

Resolution is to be promoted. We are mindful that while the

University retains excellent counsel to prosecute these matters, this comes
at a cost. Joint submissions also provide certainty for students who find
themselves before the Tribunal, sometimes facing significant penalties, but
having to get on with their lives whatever the result. Joint submissions
allow students to plan for the future.

[21]

The Tribunal operates on the basis that (as in criminal cases) it is not
required to accept a proposed joint submission. Having said that, a joint
submission should not be rejected unless it is contrnry to the public
interest in that the proposed penalty would bring the administration of
justice into dispute.

If departing from a joint submission, a Court or

8

tribunal must explain and justify its departure from the joint submission.
See Regina v. E(R.W.) 2007 ONCA 461 (CanLJJ).

[22]

The panel accepted the joint submission in this case, but it did so with
some reluctance. In the first place, the Unde11aking (to complete the series
of courses) forms the centrepiece of the joint position on penalty.

It

seemed to the panel unfortunate that the Undertaking was offered to Mr.
~ after his third recorded involvement in an incident of

plagiarism.

We do not know whether undertakings of this sort were

available in 2003 when Mr. ~ was first discovered to have
plagiarised a piece of academic work, but that would have been the logical
time for the University to have imposed the unde11aking. To encourage
Mr. ~ to complete a remedial course following his third

admission of dishonesty rang somewhat hollow with the panel.
[23]

Second, some of the facts agreed to by the University and the student left
the panel with misgivings. As noted, University counsel was careful to
state that the University accepted that the report of Dr. Ajisafe might be
submitted in support of the joint position on penalty, but that it did not

accept all of the facts in the rep01t. Counsel took the position that
questions of this sort were effectively moot given that agreement had been
reached on penalty. We accept this position, but only up to a point. It is of
course not for the panel to look behind the agreement that has been
achieved between the prosecution and the student. At the same time, the
9

facts which the panel was asked to accept included Mr. ~ s
exquisite bad luck in relation to motor vehicle accidents, coupled with a
poorly suppo11ed medical/psychiatric explanation. These left the panel
with considerable unease. The University took a halfway position that it
did not accept the truth of every mitigating circumstance relied upon by
Mr. ~ -

It simply accepted that these explanations had been

offered in mitigation at the material time. While this way of proceeding is
the result of negotiation, it runs the risk of confusing the panel.
[24]

Other panels of the Tribunal have expressed misgivings about
"undertakings" to complete remedial courses, as Ms. Harmer candidly
acknowledged. For example, in the University and Y.K (November 25,
2011; Case 631 ), the panel said the following:
The panel would, however, like to stress that while an
unde1taking can be a very useful tool in penalty and
rehabilitation, and the parties are to be commended for
working together to agree to rehabilitation or mediation,
the use and contents of the undertaking should not be
used as an excuse for the behaviour set out in the Agreed
Statement of Facts. If students do not have the requisite
knowledge and skill to comply with basic requirements
of academic life in the university, it is preferable that
these deficiencies be addressed before. and not as a
result of, repeated academic offences. [emphasis added]

[25]

We agree with this view. Further, we rely as did the panel in University v.
J \ ~ ,4 (February 29, 2012; Case 661) on the decision in University of

Toronto v. SB. (November 24, 2007; Case 488) on the following

statement:

10

It hardly needs to be said that the credibility and
academic mission of the university, and the degrees
which it awards to its students, can be greatly harmed by
the commission of offences such as plagiarism and
concoction.

[26)

In this case, we believe that the student 's conduct lies in the far outfield of
conduct which can be punished by a suspension. A penalty of expulsion
would not have been out of line for Mr. ~ .

[27]

That said, we accept the joint submission and impose the penalty set out at
paragraphs 9 to 12, above.

ADDENDUM
Motion for a Ban on Publication
[28]

Mr. ~ submitted, apparently with no notice to University counsel,
that there should be no publication of these reasons, nor should there be
any initials attached to the record of our decision. He submitted that it
would harm his psychiatric care and recovery if there were to be
publication of any identifying features, or of the reasons themselves. He
also submitted that his family company had endowed a scholarship, and
this should have some bearing on the matter.

11

[29]

University counsel strenuously resisted this position, both on the basis that the
question of publication was governed by the Joint Submission on Penally by
paragraph 3:
3.
The Parties fu11her submit that it is appropriate for the
Tribunal to report this case to the Provost by publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal, and the sanction or
sanctions imposed in the University newspapers, with the name
of the student withheld.

[30]

0-

We believe, with respect, that Mr. ~
generosity of the

s submission concerning the

donation to the University was in the circumstances

abhorrent. Ms. Harmer submitted that all students who fi nd themselves before
university tribunals should be treated with equal dignity and respect. We agree
with her.
[31]

We dismiss the motion for non-publication.

twr..r:::

PHL340 June 2011

1.

At the Dean's meeting on September 14, 2011 to discuss the allegations

in PHL340, Mr. ~ provided a letter from Dr. Ajisafe dated September 12,
2011. This letter described that Mr. ~ started to exhibit symptoms of
panic attacks in 2009 following an experience he suffered in the UK. Dr. Ajisafe
stated that he had started Mr. ~ on Ativan on June 1, 2011. A copy of
this letter is attached at Tab A.
PHL341 -April 2006

2.

In April 2006, Mr. ~ submitted an essay for academic credit in

PHL341 H5, which was worth 40% of the final grade ("PHL341 Essay"). Students
in the course were required to familiarize themselves with the Code of Behaviour

2

on Academic Matters ("Code") in order to avoid accusations of plagiarism or
academic misconduct.
3.

The PHL341 Essay was taken almost in its entirety from an in ternet

source.
4.

M r . ~ admitted at a Dean's meeting that he committed plagiarism

in the PHL341 Essay, contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code. He explained that
his mother had been in a serious car accident in 2003 for which she received
ongoing care from family members, including Mr. ~
5.

.

The Dean's Designate imposed a sanction of a reduction of 80% to his

final mark in PHL341 H5.
PHL315H5F - June 2008

6.

On June 24, 2008, Mr. ~ submitted an essay for academic credit

in PHL315H5F which was worth 50% of the final grade ("PHL315 June 24
Essay"). Much of the PHL315 June 24 Essay was taken from internet sources,
with the use of paraphrasing and synonyms.
7.

Mr. ~ subsequently claimed that he had submitted the PHL315

June 24 Essay in error as a draft. He then attempted to re-submit a revised
essay in PHL315H5F on or about July 27, 2008 ("PHL315 July 27 Essay"). The
PHL315 July 27 Essay was itself plagiarized and contained concocted footnotes.
8.

M r . ~ admitted at a Dean's meeting that he committed the offence

of plagiarism in the PHL315 June 24 Essay and the PHL315 July 27 Essay,
contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code. He explained that he had been involved
in two car accidents, one in March 2007 and one in October 2007.
9.

The Dean's Designate imposed a sanction of a final grade of zero in

PHL315H5F, a suspension from attending the university for 12 months from

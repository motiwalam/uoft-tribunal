   The Student was charged with knowingly using or possessing an
   unauthorized aid or aids or obtaining unauthorized assistance in
   connection with a final exam, contrary to s. B.i.1(b) of the Code of
   Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019 (the ‚Code‚). In the alternative,
   the Student was charged with knowingly engaging in a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not
   otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit or
   other academic advantage, contrary to s. B. i.3(b) of the Code. The
   Panel was informed at the outset of the hearing that the University
   would withdraw the charge made in the alternative if a finding of guilt
   was made on the main allegation.

   The hearing was scheduled to commence at 5:15 p.m. The Panel waited
   until 5:30 p.m. to afford the Student an opportunity to appear. Neither
   the Student nor a representative for the Student appeared at the
   hearing. The University requested that the Panel proceed in the absence
   of the Student. The Panel noted that pursuant to ss. 6 and 7 of the
   Statutory Powers Procedures Act (‚SPPA‚) and rules 17 and 21 of the
   University Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and Procedure (‚Rules‚), a
   Tribunal may proceed in the absence of a party provided that reasonable
   notice of a hearing has been given to the party in accordance with the
   SPPA and the Rules. The Panel further noted that pursuant to rule 13, a
   notice of hearing may be served by various means, including by sending
   a copy by email to the student‚s email address contained in the
   Repository of Student Information (‚ROSI‚). The University filed
   affidavit evidence outlining numerous attempts by the University to
   contact the Student. The Panel noted that the affidavit evidence
   outlined that the University had attempted to call the Student on their
   telephone numbers, sent emails to the Student‚s email address as
   recorded in ROSI, and couriered a package to the Student‚s mailing
   address in ROSI. The Panel noted that it was important to outline that
   the Student signed a form acknowledging possession of an unauthorized
   aid and, shortly thereafter, the Student ordered an e-transcript from
   the University. The Panel noted that the execution of the form and
   prompt ordering of the e-transcript suggested that the Student was
   aware of the potential that there would be some review of their
   conduct. Based on the evidence, the Panel was satisfied that the
   Student received the Notice of Hearing, and that reasonable notice has
   been provided in accordance with the Rules and the SPPA. Therefore, in
   accordance with s. 7(3) of the SPPA, the Panel proceeded to hear the
   case on its merits in the absence of the Student.

   The Panel received evidence from the Chief Presiding Officer (‚CPO‚)
   that was invigilating the final exam in question. The CPO outlined in
   their affidavit that the students writing this exam were required to
   turn off and leave all cell phones, electronic devices, and
   unauthorized study materials in a bag under their desk. While
   invigilating this exam, the CPO noticed that the Student was hunched
   over with his arm covering pages of the exam. The CPO attended the
   Student‚s desk and asked them to remove some items from their desk and
   as the Student was moving their belongings, the CPO noted that the
   Student had an iPhone and it was open to an application that looked
   like a scientific calculator. The CPO confiscated the iPhone and
   advised the Student to pick up the iPhone at the completion of the
   exam. In order to have the iPhone returned, the Student had to sign a
   form acknowledging possession of an unauthorized aid. The Panel did not
   place any weight on the Student‚s executed form because there may have
   been reasons why they signed the form even if they did not agree with
   its contents. The Panel accepted the evidence of the CPO that they
   observed the Student using an iPhone during the exam and found that the
   Student knowingly possessed an unauthorized aid, contrary to s.
   B.i.1(b). The University withdrew the charge made in the alternative.

   In determining the appropriate sanctions, the Panel received evidence
   that the Student had committed two prior academic offences, both
   related to the use of an unauthorized aids (cell phone) during an exam.
   The Panel considered the factors set out in University of Toronto and
   Mr. C (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5, 1976). With respect to the
   Student‚s character, the Panel noted that the only evidence related to
   the Student‚s character was the evidence related to this offence and
   their previous offences. The Panel also considered the likelihood of a
   repetition of the offence and was very concerned that this was not an
   isolated incident as the Student had committed the very same type of
   misconduct on two separate occasions despite written warnings and
   meetings. The Panel noted the nature of the offence specifically
   highlighting that the Student‚s actions were consistent with a plan to
   hide the use of the cell phone. Furthermore, the use of unauthorized
   aids undermines the integrity that the broader community puts in the
   University. The Panel also considered the need to deter others from
   committing a similar offence and noted that it is appropriate to send a
   strong message to students that this type of misconduct will be treated
   seriously. The Panel noted that the determination of an appropriate
   penalty depends on the assessment of these principles and factors in
   light of the individual circumstances. Furthermore, there should be
   general consistency in the approach by a Panel to sanction, so students
   are treated fairly and equitably. In reviewing this case, the Panel
   noted that expulsion would typically be available. The Panel was
   troubled by the fact that the Student had engaged in the exact same
   form of academic misconduct on three occasions, therefore a clear
   warning needed to be sent that this type of misconduct will not be
   tolerated. However, the Panel noted that there was not the same level
   of deceit as apparent in the authorities put before it by the
   University. Furthermore, the Student‚s last suspension was only for
   four months, which, in the Panel‚s view, demonstrated leniency by the
   University for which expulsion would be a departure. Accordingly, the
   Panel concluded that a suspension from the University for five years
   would be appropriate. The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a zero
   in the course; a five-year suspension; a notation on the Student‚s
   transcript until graduation; and a report to the Provost for
   publication.

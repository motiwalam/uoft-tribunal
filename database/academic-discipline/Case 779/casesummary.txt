   Student charged under s. B.i.1(d) and, in the alternative, s. B.i.3(b)
   of the Code . The charges related to allegations that the Student used
   the work of another author without attribution in an essay worth 20% of
   the overall Course grade. Turnitin software revealed a substantial
   similarity between parts of the Student‚s essay and previously
   published work. The extensive nature of the material cited without
   attribution suggested that the impugned text could not have been placed
   accidentally by the Student. The Student was not present for the
   hearing. The Panel found that reasonable notice of the hearing had been
   provided and determined that it would be appropriate for the hearing to
   proceed in the Student‚s absence.

   Student was found guilty with respect to the plagiarism charge. The
   University then withdrew the alternative charge of academic dishonesty
   not otherwise described. The Panel took into account Tribunal cases on
   plagiarism in determining the appropriate sanctions, noting that the
   Student had engaged in a deliberate act of plagiarism, that the
   importance of academic integrity had clearly been brought to the
   Student‚s attention, and that the Student had failed to cooperate with
   the University by failing to meet with the professor, failing to attend
   the hearing, and unhelpfully taking an aggressive, accusatory and
   personal tone in email communications with his professor. There was no
   evidence of the Student‚s remorse or other mitigating circumstances.
   The Panel imposed a grade assignment of zero in the Course; a 2-year
   suspension; a notation on the Student‚s academic record and transcript
   until his graduation; and that the case be reported to the Provost for
   publication.

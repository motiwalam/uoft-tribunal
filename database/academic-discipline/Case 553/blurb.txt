Trial Division – s. B.i.3(a) of Code – forged academic records – TA, Student’s brother, altered Student’s marks – TA and Student claimed that the Student did not know that his marks had been inflated – Dean’s designate decided not to charge the Student – University subsequently discovered changes to Student’s marks in an earlier course and decided to lay charges with respect to both courses – Student argued that University was barred from reversing the earlier decision – Panel found that it was not necessary to consider the issue because University failed to prove that Student knew about the changes on a balance of probabilities – no direct evidence and insufficient circumstantial evidence – Student found not guilty

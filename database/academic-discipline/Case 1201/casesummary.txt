   The Student was charged underÂ ss. B.i.1(b)Â andÂ B.i.1(d)Â of
   theâ¯Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995â¯(the âCodeâ) on the
   basis thatÂ sheÂ knowingly used or possessed an unauthorized aid,Â or
   aids,Â or obtained unauthorized assistance in a final examÂ andÂ that
   she knowingly represented as her own an idea or expression of an idea
   or work of another in a question on a test. In the alternative, the
   Student was charged underÂ s.Â B.i.3(b)Â of theÂ CodeÂ on the basis
   that the StudentÂ knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct,Â fraudÂ or misrepresentation in order to
   obtain academic credit or other academic advantageÂ in connectionÂ with
   a test.

   The Student attended the hearing and was represented by counsel.Â The
   Student and the University submitted an Agreed Statement of Fact
   (âASFâ) and a Joint Submission on Penalty (âJSPâ).Â In theÂ fall of
   2020, the Student was required to takeÂ two testsÂ eachÂ worth 20% of
   her final grade in the course. TheÂ Student admitted that during the
   second test,Â she panicked because she did not have enough time to
   finish her answers to all the questions on the test.Â The Student
   further admitted that she used the login information and password of
   another student to access that studentâs answers,Â which sheÂ usedÂ to
   answerÂ one of the questions on the test.Â Based on the facts and
   admissions set out in the ASF, the Panel found the Student
   guiltyÂ ofÂ the first two charges. Given this finding, the University
   withdrew the alternative charge.

   Counsel for the University andÂ counsel for the Student made
   submissionsÂ in support of the JSP. The University submitted that the
   proposed sanctionÂ was appropriate. The UniversityÂ noted for the Panel
   that the Student admitted to the offence from the outset and
   immediately made it clear that the other student had not been involved
   in the matter.Â The University also noted that it was the Studentâs
   first offence, the Student was under great stress, and the offences
   were notÂ premeditated and deliberate.Â However, the University asked
   the Panel to note that the offences were serious and had potential to
   adversely affect an innocent third party.Â In support of their
   position, the University pointed the Panel toÂ a number
   ofÂ previousÂ decisionsÂ whichÂ outlined the type of penalty typically
   imposedÂ forÂ a studentÂ whoÂ had been found guiltyÂ ofÂ the same
   offences. Furthermore, counselÂ noted that in previous cases, the
   Tribunal had ruled that it would only rejectÂ a JSP in circumstances
   where giving it effect would be contraryÂ to the public interest or
   would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.Â The
   Studentâs counsel emphasized, in her submissions, that the Student had
   admitted guilt, cooperated with the University, and took responsibility
   for her actions.Â Furthermore, counsel outlined that the Student was
   emotionally distressedÂ as a result ofÂ the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
   the resulting lack of contact with her family, andÂ her
   medicalÂ conditions.Â Counsel further submitted thatÂ this was the
   Studentâs first offence and that the consequences for the Student would
   be very significant as she would not be able to receive her degree for
   another two yearsÂ which would make it more difficult for her to gain
   employment.Â In addition, since the StudentÂ wasÂ on a student visa,
   once the Studentâs classes end, she may have to leave Canada.Â Counsel
   for the Student explained that since the Student was currently
   attending courses at the University,Â having the suspension begin later
   would allow the StudentÂ to complete the course work required to earn
   the degree she was pursing.

   The Panel noted that in cases where the University and the student have
   reached an agreement on penalty it is notÂ itsÂ role to decide on the
   penaltyÂ itÂ mightÂ haveÂ imposedÂ but rather the PanelÂ must determine
   whether the proposed penalty falls within a reasonable range of
   outcomes.Â The Panel noted that the Student was diagnosed withÂ a
   number ofÂ medical conditions that were suspectedly causing daytime
   sleepiness. She also was isolated from her family and worried about the
   financial consequences of failing the course.Â UponÂ review of
   theÂ casesÂ submitted by counselÂ and the JSP, the Panel acceptedÂ the
   JSPÂ since the proposed sanction fell within the range of reasonable
   outcomes based on the evidence before it.Â The Panel noted
   thatÂ postponing the suspension to allow the Student to complete the
   other courses she required to complete her degree is reasonable in this
   case since the Student had no record of any prior academic offences,
   admitted to the offences, and cooperated with the
   University.Â Furthermore, the postponement of the suspension does not
   take the proposed penalty outside of the reasonable range of
   outcomes.Â The Panel imposed the following sanction:Â final grade of
   zero in the course; two-year suspension; a three-year notation on the
   transcript; andÂ a report to the Provost forÂ publication.

Discipline Appeals Board – University appeal from acquittal of plagiarism charges – Student found guilty of unauthorized aid offences but acquitted of plagiarism offences arising from the same events – Tribunal erred in concluding that plagiarism under s. B.i.1(d) of the Code requires an element of theft – explanatory appendices are not intended to derogate or otherwise modify Code offences – interpreting plagiarism as requiring an element of theft is unworkable and undesirable – the rule against multiple convictions applies where there is a relationship of sufficient proximity between the facts and the offences which form the basis of the charges – appeal dismissed

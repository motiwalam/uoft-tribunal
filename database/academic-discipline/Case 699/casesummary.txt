   Student charged with one offence under s. B.i.1(e), one offence under
   s. B.i.1(d), and in the alternative, one offence under s. B.i.3(b) of
   the Code. The charges related to an allegation that the Student
   resubmitted work for which she had previously received credit. The
   Student pleaded guilty and the matter proceeded by way of an Agreed
   Statement of Facts. The work that was resubmitted by the Student for
   credit was originally authored by a group that included the Student.
   The resubmitted work did not include appropriate reference to the
   contributions made by the Studentâs former group members. The Panel
   accepted the Studentâs guilty plea and the University withdrew the
   alternative charge. The parties presented a Joint Submission on
   Penalty. This was the Studentâs second offence. The Student had been
   sanctioned for similar conduct at the Decanal level a year prior to the
   current hearing. The Student admitted to committing the offence early
   in the process and subsequently cooperated with the University. The
   Panel accepted the joint submission and imposed a final grade of FZ in
   one course, a four-year suspension, a five-year notation on the
   Studentâs transcript, and ordered that the case be reported to the
   Provost for publication.

   The Student was charged with knowingly obtaining and/or providing
   unauthorized assistance in connection with three terms tests (‚Term
   Tests‚) in ECO2201Y1 (‚the Course‚), contrary to s. B.i.1(b) of the
   Code. In the alternative, the Student was charged under s. B.i.1(d) of
   the Code for knowingly representing as their own an idea or expression
   of an idea or work of another in connection with the Term Tests. In the
   further alternative, the Student was charged with knowingly engaging in
   a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code to obtain
   academic credit or advantage, contrary to s. B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   The Student attended the hearing and was represented by counsel. The
   hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts (‚ASF‚)
   submitted by the University and the Student along with a Joint Book of
   Documents (‚JBD‚). According to the ASF, the Student was enrolled in
   the Course in Fall 2020 and Winter 2021. The Course was taught online
   due to the pandemic. The Term Tests were administered online, and the
   syllabus stated that students were not permitted to collaborate with
   one another on the Term Tests. In March 2021, a teaching assistant
   notified the instructor that a phrase kept appearing in students‚
   answers. After detailed investigation, the teaching team found that a
   large number of students had collaborated on some or all of the Term
   Tests. The instructor found that several of the Student‚s answers to
   Term Tests 2, 3, and 4 were highly similar to that of other students.

   In February 2022, the Student sent the Academic Integrity office a
   letter in which he apologized for committing an academic offence in
   Term Test 3. At the Dean‚s Designate meeting, the Student admitted to
   obtaining unauthorized assistance in Term Tests 2, 3, and 4 through
   WeChat. After considering the ASF and JBD, the Panel accepted the
   Student‚s guilty plea and found the Student guilty of three counts of
   knowingly obtaining and/or providing unauthorized assistance contrary
   to s. B.i.1(b) of the Code. The University withdrew the alternative
   charges.

   The University and the Student submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty
   (‚JSP‚). In determining the appropriate sanctions, the Panel considered
   the seriousness of the offence, the circumstances of the pandemic and
   the need for deterrence. The Panel also noted that there was a
   likelihood that the Student might commit another offence due to their
   two prior offences. The Panel also noted that the Student‚s behaviour
   demonstrates a breach of trust that causes detriment to the University.
   The Panel also considered several mitigating factors, such as the
   Student‚s cooperation, the ASF, and the JSP, which showed insight and
   remorse. The Student also voluntarily elected to attend academic
   workshops indicating his desire to rehabilitate his academic career and
   complete his degree with integrity. The Panel found the JSP reasonable
   and accepted it.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a final grade of zero in the
   Course; a four-year and four-month suspension from the University; a
   notation of the sanction on the Student‚s academic record and
   transcript for a period of six years or until graduation, whichever
   comes first; and a report to the Provost for publication.

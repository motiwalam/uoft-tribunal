   Grievances

   The Student was charged with knowingly engaging in a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not
   otherwise described in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019
   (the ‚Code‚) in connection with a term test in order to obtain academic
   credit, contrary to s. B.i.3(b) of the Code. The Student was also
   charged with knowingly representing as their own, an idea or expression
   of an idea, or work of another in a writing assignment, contrary to s.
   B.i.1(d) of the Code. The Student was further charged with knowingly
   forging, or in any other way, altering or falsifying a document or
   evidence required by the University, or uttering, circulating or making
   use of such forged, altered or falsified document or evidence, contrary
   to s. B.i.1(a) of the Code. In the alternative, the Student was charged
   with knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection with a
   writing assignment and knowingly engaging in a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation in order
   to obtain academic credit by submitting a forged, altered or falsified
   invoice, contrary to s. B.i.1(b) and B.i.3(b) of the Code,
   respectively.¬  In the further alternative, the Student was charged
   with three counts of knowingly engaging in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise
   described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit or other
   academic advantage in connection a writing assignment, contrary to s.
   B. i.3(b) of the Code.

   The hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts
   (‚ASF‚). The Panel noted that the ASF outlined that the Provost
   withdrew the charge made in relation to the term test under s. B.i.3(b)
   of the Code. With respect to the remaining charges, the Student
   admitted that they (a) knowingly represented as their own an idea or
   expression of an idea or work of another; (b) knowingly obtained
   unauthorized assistance; and (c) knowingly engaged in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
   not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit
   or other academic advantage in connection with a writing assignment.

   Regarding the invoice submitted in support of the Student‚s position
   that they did not commit an academic offence in connection with the
   term test, the Panel noted that the ASF outlined that an Academic
   Integrity Assistant (‚AIA‚) conducted various searches to verify the
   authenticity of the invoice. The AIA found that the name of the company
   on the invoice did not appear in any Google searches and when the AIA
   attended the address for the company listed on the invoice, no company
   by that name existed at that address. The Panel received affidavit
   evidence of an employee of the car repair shop located at the addressed
   listed for the company on the invoice. Their affidavit outlined¬  that
   to the best of their knowledge, since 2017, there has never been a
   company by the name listed on the invoice at that location. The Student
   admits that the invoice is (a) forged, altered, or falsified; (b) the
   invoice was a document or evidence required by the University; and (c)
   the Student uttered, circulated or made use of the invoice. The Student
   denied that they knew or reasonably ought to have known that the
   invoice was forged, altered, or falsified. The Panel was divided. The
   Majority Panel (the ‚Majority‚) found the Student guilty under s.
   B.i.1(a) of the Code. The Majority noted that a student does not need
   actual knowledge, but it can be established on an objective test of
   whether a student knew or ought to have known. Furthermore, the Code
   penalizes not just intentional acts of forgery but also acts of forgery
   which result from unreasonable ignorance or reckless indifference. The
   University Tribunal‚s Appeal Division confirmed this principle in
   University of Toronto and C.Z. , (Case No. 512, July 27, 2006), in
   respect to the offence of plagiarism. The Majority found that this
   principle applies equally to forgery offences. The Majority noted that
   where there are circumstances present for a student to reasonably
   believe that a document required by the University may be forged,
   altered or falsified, before submitting the document, a student should
   take steps to assess the authenticity of the document. Otherwise,
   students could blindly submit documents to the University without
   considering their authenticity and face no consequences under the Code.
   Furthermore, such a result would undermine the purpose of forgery
   offences which is to foster and support the integrity of the University
   community. It was the Student‚s evidence that upon receipt of the
   invoice, they checked the invoice to confirm whether their name and
   amount was accurate. Based on the evidence before it, the Majority
   found that in the suspicious circumstances of this case and the
   awareness of the University‚s need of the invoice as part of the
   academic discipline proceeding, a reasonable person would have taken
   some additional steps to verify and assess whether the invoice was
   authentic. The Majority further found that the Student did not need to
   be certain of the authenticity of the invoice when they chose to submit
   it to the University, but they also could not be recklessly indifferent
   to its authenticity, which they were.

   In determining sanction, the Panel considered the Joint Submission on
   Penalty (‚JSP‚). The Panel noted that the JSP in this case is
   reasonable. The Panel took into consideration the seriousness of the
   offences and the fact that these were not the Student‚s first offences.
   Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Student may commit another
   offence. The Panel noted that forgery and plagiarism are on the most
   serious end of the spectrum of Code offences because these offences are
   a breach of the University‚s trust relationship with its students. The
   Panel also considered certain mitigating factors such as the Student‚s
   cooperation in the process and entering into the ASF and JSP, thereby
   showing insight and remorse. The Panel imposed the following sanctions:
   a grade of zero in the course; a five-year suspension; a notation on
   the transcript for six years or until graduation; and a report to the
   Provost for publication.

   Trial Division â unauthorized aid - substituting completed test booklet
   for blank booklet during in-class test â factual issue â insufficient
   evidence to satisfy onus of proof on University â possibilities
   inconsistent with inference of guilt â student not guilty
   Student charged under the Code. The charges related to allegations that
   the Student brought a completed test booklet to an examination room and
   substituted it for a blank booklet during an in-class term test. The
   Student denied the allegations. The Tribunal considered whether the act
   occurred and if so whether there was sufficient evidence to prove the
   allegations. The Panel considered all the evidence, including the
   testimony of the course professor and Student and the Studentâs
   academic history, and weighed all the available inferences from the
   circumstantial evidence, and found that the fact that the Student
   submitted an unstamped booklet of a slightly different colour was
   insufficient to satisfy the onus of proof on the University as stated
   in the Code.Â  The Panel found the Student not guilty.

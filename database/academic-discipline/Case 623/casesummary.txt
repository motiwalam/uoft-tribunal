   S tudent charged und e r s. B.i.1 (c) a n d s . B.i. 1 (a) of the Code.
   The charges r e la t ed t o allegations t h at the Student had another
   student su b mit the e x am s h e wrote in the S tud e nt's name while
   h e s u bmit t ed h i s exam with a mad e -up name and stu d e n t
   number. T he St u de n t did not a tt e nd t h e hearing. The Uni v e r
   s i ty had tried to contact t he Student t h rough e mail a n d by
   courier to th e Student's a ddr ess on ROSI, which t h e Student u p
   dat e d recently in order to regi s t e r for a fall c o u r se. The U
   n i versi t y a l so poin t e d t o its p o li cy requiring s tuden t s
   to pr o v i de a current a nd valid p o s t a l a d dr e ss as well as
   the address for a university-issued e - mail, and t hat failure to d o
   so would not b e con s i d ere d "an a c c e p t a b l e rationale" for
   f a ili n g to receive official c o r respo n d ence from t h e Un i v
   ersity. T h e Pan el found tha t i t wa s reasonable for the U ni v er
   s i t y t o r e l y on i ts policy, stating that to fi n d o t h e
   rwise would impose extraordinary co s t s on the Univ e r sity while
   also aiding a nd abetting a student see k i n g t o evade rec e i v ing
   noti c e. The P a nel concluded that reaso n a b l e n o t i ce had b e
   e n provided . The D ean's Designate t e s tif i e d tha t the Student
   a dmitted to com m itt i ng the of f e nces. The Stud e nt cl a i med
   that h e acted on the sugge s tion of the o th e r student c
   ommunicated t o him by a n ote in the exam room. In l i ght of t h e
   uncontradictedÂ  e v iden c e, the Pan e l found t he St u dent g u
   ilty under s. B.i. 1 (c) a n d s . B .i. 1 (a). As for penalty, the
   University propo sed a fiv e -ye a r suspensi on, s tati n g that it
   regarded th e offences as v e r y seri o u s and th e only rea son it
   was no t seeking a recommendation f o r expulsion was because the S t u
   dent's c o nduct did not a p p ear t o be premeditated. Had th e S tu d
   e n t written down the correct stu d ent number of the o ther student
   in v olv e d, the offence would likely never h a ve b een d e t ected.
   The Panel accepted the s u bmi ssion by the University and im p osed a
   gr a d e assignment of zero in t he course; a five-year s u sp e n
   sion; a seven -year notation on t h e St u d en t ' s transcript; and a
   report be i s s ued t o t h e Pro v o s t.

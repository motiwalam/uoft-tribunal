Discipline Appeals Board – Student appeals on the basis that the Tribunal did not address that the University failed to prove that the difference on her exam demonstrated that she had falsified the exam, that the Tribunal did not adequately consider her evidence, and that she is entitled to the presumption of innocence – request to reverse the Tribunal’s decision – s. B.i.1(a) of the Code – falsified exam – Student asked the Discipline Appeal Board (“DAB”) to reassess and reexamine the evidence – DAB does not have the jurisdiction nor the relevant information to be able to attempt to reassess the weight of the evidence on which the Tribunal relied – the University is required to establish its case on a balance of probabilities and not on the basis of a criminal standard (beyond a reasonable doubt) – there was a reasonable basis for each of the Tribunal’s specific findings – appeal dismissed

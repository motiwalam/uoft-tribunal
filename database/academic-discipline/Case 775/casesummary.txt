   Grievances
   Trial Division â s. B.i.1(a) and s. B.i.3(b) of the Code â Agreed
   Statement of Facts â falsified documents and documents with falsified
   information â exam deferral sought â doctorâs medical certificate â
   Â personal statements â admission of guilt â Joint Submission on
   Penalty â mitigating circumstances â grade of zero in five courses;
   five-year suspension; notation on transcript until graduation; report
   to Provost for publication
   The Student was charged with seven offences under s. B.i.1(a) and, in
   the alternative, one charge s. B.i.3(b) of the Code . The charges
   related to allegations that the student had falsified several documents
   in support of petitions for exam deferral and a request for academic
   accommodation. The hearing proceeded by way of an Agreed Statement of
   Facts (ASF) and the University withdrew the alternative charge.
   The ASF stated that the Student submitted a petition containing a
   personal statement and two Student Medical Certificates which she had
   altered in order to defer writing exams in four courses. The petition
   was granted on the basis of the false information. Two years later the
   Student submitted a Verification of Student Illness or Injury
   certificate to excuse her absence from a mid-term test. She then
   submitted a second petition containing a personal statement that
   falsely stated when the Student had attended the clinic and
   Verification of Student Illness or Injury certificate with the date
   altered. The Student later met with the Deanâs Designate and admitted
   having committed the above offences.
   The Student was 22 and lived with her mother following her parentsâ
   separation five years earlier. Her mother moved back to South Korea and
   the Student funded her education through OSAP loans and bursaries. The
   Student had some health issues and was stressed at the time of the
   submission of the first petition. On both occasions she saw doctors but
   could not afford a note the first time and had altered the second note,
   though a doctor confirmed that she had seen her around that date. The
   Student expressed remorse and a desire to return to the University.
   The Panel found the Student guilty of the first seven charges and the
   University withdrew the alternative charge.
   The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts on Penalty (ASFP)
   and a Joint Submission on Penalty (JSP) requesting a grade of zero in
   the five courses, a five-year suspension, a notation in the Studentâs
   academic record until graduation, and that the matter be reported to
   the Provost for publication. The ASFP confirmed the Student had medical
   conditions, had sought and obtained permission to defer tests for
   medical reasons, and was sanctioned twice before for having a cell
   phone during an exam. The parties submitted similar cases with JSPs in
   support of the JSP, noting that a five-year suspension was in the range
   of sanctions and that the University was not considering the two prior
   incidents âoffences.â The Panel was not bound by these cases but panels
   give high deference to JSPs, and noted a particular case in which the
   rejection of a JSP was overturned on appeal. However, even weighing the
   mitigating factors in this case, the Panel accepted the JSP and
   assigned a grade of zero in the five courses at issue, imposed a
   five-year suspension, ordered a notation on the Studentâs transcript
   until graduation and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost
   for publication.

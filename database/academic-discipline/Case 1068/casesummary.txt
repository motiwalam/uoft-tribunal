   The Student was charged withâ¯one count underÂ s.Â B.i.1(a) of
   theÂ Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters,
   1995â¯(âCodeâ)Â forÂ knowingly forging or in any other way altering or
   falsifying a document or evidence required by the University of
   Toronto, or uttering, circulatingÂ or usingÂ such forged, altered
   orÂ falsified document, namely aÂ Verification of Student Illness or
   InjuryÂ form, which she submitted in support of her request for
   academic accommodation orÂ relief inÂ aÂ course.â¯Alternatively, she
   wasÂ alsoÂ chargedÂ under s.Â B.i.3(b) of theÂ Code.

   Neither the Student nor a legal representative of the Student appeared
   at the hearing.â¯As a preliminary issue, the UniversityÂ requested that
   theÂ hearingÂ proceedÂ in the absence of the Student.Â ItÂ provided
   evidence that the Student had been servedÂ with various
   documentsÂ byÂ emailÂ toÂ theÂ email addressÂ the Student had provided
   toÂ the UniversityâsÂ Repository of Student Information
   (âROSIâ).Â Documents served by email includeÂ aÂ letter regarding the
   charges,Â a copy of theÂ TribunalâsÂ Rules of Practice and
   ProcedureÂ (âRulesâ),Â aÂ pamphlet for Downtown Legal Services,Â the
   Universityâs disclosure brief,Â a copy of theÂ UniversityâsÂ Policy on
   Official Correspondence with Students, information concerning the
   scheduling of the hearingÂ andÂ affidavits on which the University
   intended to rely upon at the hearing.Â The University alsoÂ tried
   calling the Student atÂ different times of the day, at the phone number
   that the Student had providedÂ inÂ ROSI.Â The University led evidence
   establishingÂ someone had accessedÂ the Studentâs university-issued
   email account afterÂ service of these documents. TheÂ PanelÂ concluded
   that the Student was given reasonable notice of the hearing in
   accordance with the notice requirements set out in theÂ Statutory
   Powers Procedure Act (âActâ)Â and theÂ Rules.Â ItÂ proceeded to hear
   the case on its merits in the absence of the Student.

   For the course in question, attendance in studio, lectures and
   exercises was mandatory.Â Students were advised that if they missed
   class as a result of illness, they were required to
   submitÂ aÂ Verification of Student Illness or InjuryÂ formÂ completed
   by a doctor.Â Among other things, the course syllabusÂ contained
   provisions regarding attendance, participationÂ andÂ lateÂ submission
   of assignmentsÂ due toÂ illnessÂ and other circumstances.

   The evidence established that the StudentÂ hadÂ emailed her
   instructorÂ advising that she was unable to attendÂ class due to
   illnessÂ and attaching a copy of aÂ Verification of Student Illness or
   InjuryÂ formÂ signed by a doctor.Â The Student subsequently
   missedÂ aÂ class andÂ in response to the
   instructorâsÂ emailÂ askingÂ whether she was still ill,Â sheÂ provided
   anotherÂ signedÂ copy of aÂ Verification of Student Illness or
   InjuryÂ form, whichÂ appeared to be from the same
   doctor.Â TheÂ UniversityÂ contacted theÂ doctor andÂ discovered that
   theÂ second medical noteÂ had beenÂ forged.Â The doctorâs
   affidavitÂ establishes thatÂ he had not seen the Student on the date
   specified on the second medical noteÂ and had not
   completedÂ thatÂ note.

   The Panel found theÂ Student guiltyÂ under s. B.i.1(a) of
   theÂ Code.Â In determining theÂ sanction, the PanelÂ notedÂ there was
   no evidence regarding the StudentâsÂ character other than the facts
   relating to this offence and the lack of response fromÂ the
   Student.Â While the Student did not have a priorÂ record of academic
   offences, theÂ Panel was unable to make any findings regarding the
   likelihood of a repetition of this offenceÂ due to theÂ Studentâs
   failure to attendÂ the hearing andÂ aÂ meetingÂ withÂ the Office of the
   Registrar and Student Services, DanielsÂ Faculty,Â to discussÂ the
   allegation of academic misconduct.Â The PanelÂ consideredÂ theÂ serious
   and deliberate nature of the offenceÂ and the detriment to the
   University.Â It stated that forgery is considered a serious offence,
   especially in these circumstances.Â It added that givenÂ the size of
   the University, and the fact that the University is unable to verify
   everyÂ single medical note submitted toÂ instructors, the University
   must be able to trustÂ thatÂ students are submitting
   legitimateÂ Verification of Student Illness or InjuryÂ forms and
   thatÂ accommodationÂ requests are legitimate.

   Since theÂ Student did not participate inÂ theÂ hearing, the Panel
   foundÂ no evidenceÂ of mitigating or extenuatingÂ circumstances.Â The
   PanelÂ accepted the Universityâs concerns that the Studentâs conduct
   inÂ forging medical notes implicated medicalÂ professionals
   andÂ undermined theÂ integrity of those charged with providing those
   medical notes, as well as theÂ Universityâs procedure for assessing and
   granting accommodations to its students.Â ItÂ also statedÂ that
   theÂ University and theÂ Tribunal must send a strong message to other
   students that such misconduct isÂ considered a serious offence.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions:Â gradeÂ assignmentÂ of
   zeroÂ in the course;Â aÂ two-yearÂ suspension;Â three-yearÂ notation of
   the sanction on academic record and transcriptÂ from the date
   ofÂ theÂ Order;Â and publication by the Provost of a notice of the
   decision and sanctions imposed,Â with the Studentâs name withheld.

[8)

Discipline counsel reviewed the Agreed Statement of Facts supp01ting the Joint
Submission on Penalty, a summary of which is provided here:

-3-

Case S24

1.

The Student has previously admitted to committing two other academic offences for
which he received sanctions at the Divisional Level, specifically:
a. On November 22, 2006, the Student admitted that he had taken computer code
from a friend without that friend's permission and had used it to obtain
unauthorized assistance to complete his own computer assigtunent in CSC l 08H.
On that day, Professor Betty Roots, Dean's Designate for Academic Behaviour
sent a letter to the Student imposing the following sanction:
a grade of zero on the assignment;
a further 20 mark reduction in the course; and
a two-year transcript notation.
b. On February 29, 2008, the Student admitted that, 011 February 15, 2008, he had
submitted an essay in ECO301 YI Y, which was copied entirely from
uuacknowledged internet sources. On that day, Professor John Britton, the
Dean's Designate for Academic Discipline imposed the following sanctiou:
a grade of zero on the assigrnnent;
a suspension to run from May 15, 2008 to May 14, 2009; and
an annotation until graduatiou that the Student had been suspeuded for
academic misconduct.

ii. The Student admits that he committed his third offence on March 27, 2008, after
having been advised that he would be suspended for one year at the end of the term.
iii. The Student states that during late 2007 and 2008, he was affected by an illness
suffered by his father. The Student states that the problem with his father's prostate
gland was first detected in November or December of 2007. · In January 2008, the
Student states that his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer, underwent
treatment, and was admitted to hospital for surgery on February 25, 2008. The
Student states that his father had post-surgery lingering effects until June or July of
2008.
[9]

Mr. Centa drew the panel's attention to the period of suspension proposed by the parties,
noting that, if the panel accepted the Joint Submission on Penalty, pmi of the Student's
suspension would run concmrently with the suspension imposed ·at the Divisional level
on February 29, 2008. As such, the proposed sanction would result in a 4-year and 4month suspension in respect of the Student's second and third offences.

(1 OJ

The Tribunal was reminded by counsel that, while not obliged to accept a joint
submission on penalty, the joint submission should not be rejected unless to accept it
would be contrary to the public interest or bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The Panel accepts and acknowledges that this is a high threshold for declining
to accept a joint submission.
·

-4-

[11]

Having regard to the facts in this case, in particular the aggravating fact that this was a
third offence involving academic dishonesty, the mitigating facts that there was an
admission, a guilty plea and co-operation by the student, the Panel is of the view that the
agreed-upon sanction was within an appropriate range of sanction in the circumstances.

Sanction

[12]

The Panel therefore accepted the joint submission on penalty, and makes the following
order:
(a)

the assignment ofa final grade of zero in the course PHY205;

(b)

a suspension from the University of Toronto from Febrnary 2, 2009 to September
1, 2012;

(c)

a notation on the Student's academic record and transcript stating that he has been
found to have committed academic offences, such notation to nm from Febnmry
2, 2009 to September l, 2014; and

(d)

a report of this case to the Provost who may publish a notice of the decision of the
University of Toronto Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the Student's
name withheld.

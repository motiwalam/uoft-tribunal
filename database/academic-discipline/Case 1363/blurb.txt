Trial Division – s. B.i.1(b) of Code – unauthorized assistance during an online term test – Student’s answer corresponded with a different version of the test – finding of guilt – hearing proceeded in the Student’s absence – University went beyond what was required to serve the Student with the charges and notice of hearing – offence harms the institution and the academic process – associated penalty must act as general deterrent – a grade of zero in the course; a two-year suspension; a three-year notation on the Student’s transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

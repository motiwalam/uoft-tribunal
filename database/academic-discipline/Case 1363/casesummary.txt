   The Student was charged under section B.i.1(b) of the Code for
   knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection with a term
   test. They were also charged in the alternative for knowingly engaging
   in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code.

   The Student did not attend the hearing. Relying on section 6 of the
   Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.22 (‚SPPA‚), rule 17
   of the University Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and Procedure, and the
   University‚s Policy on Official Correspondence with Students, the Panel
   found that the University had complied with its obligations to provide
   reasonable notice of the charges and the hearing to the Student by
   delivering all its letters and notices to the Student via the Student‚s
   email address in ROSI. The Panel also found that the University went
   beyond what was required by trying to telephone the Student and leaving
   voicemail messages. The Panel ordered that the hearing proceed in the
   Student‚s absence, as permitted by section 7(3) of the SPPA and rule 21
   of the Rules.

   The Panel received evidence establishing that the Student‚s professor
   had prepared multiple versions of the term test at issue to prevent
   students from collaborating with each other. These versions were
   assigned randomly to students. The evidence showed that the Student had
   received version 4 of question 2, but their answer corresponded with
   version 5. The Panel found that, on a balance of probabilities, the
   Student had violated the Code by collaborating with someone who had
   received version 5, or by somehow improperly accessing answers to
   version 5. It found the Student guilty of obtaining unauthorized
   assistance. The University withdrew the alternative charge.

   In imposing the sanction, the Panel indicated that the onus was on the
   Student to put forward mitigating evidence, and none was presented. It
   noted there was no evidence of a pattern of misconduct and nothing to
   show that the Student had learned from their mistake or that they
   appreciated its gravity. The Panel also noted the lack of evidence of
   remorse or insight on the Student‚s part. It indicated that obtaining
   unauthorized assistance is an extremely serious offence that harms the
   institution and the academic process. Additionally, it held that this
   offence is a serious breach of academic integrity and can be seen as an
   attempt to defraud the University. According to the Panel, the Student
   gave in to the temptation to seek assistance during an online test to
   try to obtain a better result than they felt they could otherwise
   achieve. It also noted that the associated penalty must act as a
   general deterrent.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a grade of zero in the
   course; a two-year suspension; a three-year notation on the Student‚s
   transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

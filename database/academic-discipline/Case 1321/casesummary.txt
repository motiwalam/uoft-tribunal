   The Student was charged with two counts of knowingly representing as
   their own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another in
   connection with several homework assignments, and tests in a course,
   contrary to s. B.i.1(d) of the Code . In the alternative, the Student
   was charged with two counts of knowingly obtaining unauthorized
   assistance in connection with the Assessments, contrary to s. B.i.1(b)
   of the Code . The Student was also charged with one count of knowingly
   obtaining unauthorized assistance in connection with quizzes in the
   course. In the alternative to that charge, the Student was charged with
   knowingly representing as their own an idea or expression of an idea or
   work of another in connection to the quizzes. In the alternative to all
   the foregoing charges, the Student was charged with three counts
   knowingly engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or
   misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the
   Code in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of
   any kind in connection to the assessments in the course, contrary to
   section B.I.3(b) of the Code .

   The Student did not attend the hearing and was not represented by
   counsel. The University asked the Tribunal to find that the Student had
   been provided with reasonable notice of the hearing, and that the
   hearing should proceed in the Student‚s absence, under rule 21 of the
   Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and Procedure and section 7 of the
   Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 22. The Panel found
   that the Student was active in corresponding with the Student Academic
   Integrity office and with Assistant Discipline Counsel, but ceased
   correspondence at a later date without explanation. The Panel was
   further satisfied that the Student had received reasonable notice of
   the hearing in accordance with the Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and
   Procedure and section 7 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act . The
   Panel made an additional finding that Assistant Discipline Counsel for
   the University was not obligated under the Law Society of Ontario‚s
   Rules of Professional Conduct to cease communicating directly with the
   Student after being informed by the Student that they were represented
   by counsel whom the University was unable to contact or locate on the
   Law Society of Ontario‚s Lawyer and Paralegal directory.

   The Student was enrolled in a course in which students were required to
   submit several assessments for credit including, six homework
   assignments, 24 quizzes, and a final test. Students were required to
   complete each of the Assessments independently. With respect to five of
   the six homework assessments, the Panel found, based on the evidence
   adduced by the University, that the Student‚s answers were highly
   similar in structure, notation and method to those posted on Chegg (the
   ‚Chegg Answers‚) and that the Student had knowingly represented as
   their own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another, contrary
   to section B.i.1(d) of the Code. In the case of one homework
   assignment, in which the Student‚s answers were not similar to the
   Chegg Answers, the Panel found that the Student had nevertheless viewed
   several answers on Chegg before submitting the homework assignment. The
   Panel concluded that notwithstanding its finding that the Student did
   not incorporate any of the Chegg Answers, the Student had knowingly
   obtained assistance in connection with the homework assignment contrary
   to section B.i.1(b) of the Code. With respect to the final test, the
   Panel additionally found the Student guilty of plagiarism contrary to
   s. B.i.1(d) of the Code where the Panel found that the Student‚s
   answers to numerous questions on the final test contained unusual
   similarities to Chegg Answers to the same questions.

   Finally, with respect to the quizzes, the Student was alleged to have
   received unauthorized assistance with respect to 23 of the 24 quizzes
   in the course. The Panel heard evidence that the professor in the
   course was prompted to review the answers upon an admission of another
   Student in the course that they had collaborated with other students in
   the course on certain assessments, including the quizzes. The professor
   observed that the Student had submitted similar answers to another
   student in the class based on submission time and similar scoring. The
   Panel concluded that, based on the evidence, including identical
   incorrect answers, the Student was guilty on a balance of probabilities
   of unauthorized assistance contrary to section B.i.1(b) of the Code
   with respect to 21 of the 23 quizzes. The Panel found the Student was
   not guilty of the offence with respect to two of the quizzes where the
   only evidence tendered in respect of such assessments was an admission
   by another student as to his collaboration with the Student.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Tribunal considered the
   factors set out in University of Toronto and Mr. C. (Case No.
   1976/77-3, November 5, 1976) and a book of authorities submitted by the
   University. The Panel found that the Student did not participate in a
   Dean‚s Designate meeting, attend the hearing, or make any attempt to
   take responsibility for their conduct. While such lack of participation
   was not an aggravating factor, the Panel found that there was no
   evidence of mitigating circumstances that would otherwise merit a more
   lenient sanction imposed on the basis of the Student‚s character. The
   Panel refused to consider the Student‚s failure to respond Assistant
   Discipline Counsel‚s emails, and to otherwise move the matter forward
   promptly, as an aggravating factor, particularly in light of Assistant
   Discipline Counsel‚s unexplained and unreasonably lengthy delay in
   attempting to communicate with the Student over a five month period.
   With respect to aggravating factors, the Panel did, however, conclude
   that there was a likelihood of repetition given the number of offences
   in the matter, and the significant time and resources required to
   prepare for the hearing which the Student failed to attend.

   Based on the above factors and its review of similar cases, the Panel
   imposed the following sanction: a final grade of zero in the Course, a
   three-year suspension; and a four-year notation on the Student‚s
   transcript.

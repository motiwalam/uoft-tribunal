A. Charges
1.

On November 15, 2023, this Panel of the University Tribunal held a hearing to
consider the charges brought by the University of Toronto (the “University”) against
Y

S

(the “Student”) under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 2019

(the “Code”).
2.

Those charges were detailed in a letter to the Student dated January 12, 2022, as
follows:

7. On or about August 24, 2020, you knowingly represented as your own an idea or
expression of an idea or work of another in a test in the Course, contrary to section
B.I.1(d) of the Code.
8. In the alternative to Charge #7, on or about August 24, 2020, you knowingly obtained
unauthorized assistance in a test in the Course, contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the
Code.
9. In the further alternative to Charges #7 and #8, on or about August 24, 2020, you
knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic
credit or other academic advantage of any kind in connection with a test in the
Course, contrary to section B.I.3(b) of the Code.

3.

At the time of the Charges, the Student was an undergraduate at the University of
Toronto, in the Faculty of Arts and Science.

4.

The Student did not attend the hearing. They were not represented by counsel.
The Tribunal called the hearing to order on November 15, 2023, at the scheduled
9:45 AM start time, through Zoom.

B. Notice and Hearing in the Student’s Absence
5.

As the Student did not attend the hearing, counsel for the Provost asked the
Tribunal to find that the Student had been provided with reasonable notice of the
hearing, and that the hearing should proceed in the Student’s absence, under rule

39688914.1
40839768.1

8

21 of the Tribunal’s Rules of Practice and Procedure (“Rules”), and section 7 of
the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 22 (the “Act”).
6.

Rules 17 and 21 and sections 6 and 7 require that the Provost provide the Student
with adequate notice of the hearing before the Panel proceeds in the Student’s
absence. These provisions do not require the Provost to prove that the Student
actually received the notice. Rather, they require that the Provost establish that the
University took reasonable steps to notify the Student of the charges against them
and of the hearing. As explained below, we concluded that it did so.
(i) Rules relating to Service

7.

The University’s Policy on Official Correspondence with Students requires
students enrolled at the University to maintain a current and valid postal address
and an address for a University-issued email account in their ROSI records, to
update their records when this information changes, and to monitor and retrieve
their mail and email on a frequent and consistent basis.

8.

Rule 13 of the Tribunal’s Rules states that charges, notices of hearings, disclosure
and other materials may be served on students by a variety of means, including by
personal service, by sending a copy of the document by courier to the student’s
mailing address contained in ROSI, by sending a copy of the document to the
student’s e-mail address contained in ROSI, or by any other means authorized by
the University’s Policy on Official Correspondence with Students.

9.

A long period of time has elapsed between when this matter was first brought to
the Student’s attention and the hearing of this matter. Over the course of the more
than two-year period, up until May 2023, the Student was active in corresponding
with the Student Academic Integrity office (“SAI”) in the Faculty of Arts and Science
and with Assistant Discipline Counsel (but often only on, or very close to, a
deadline provided by either SAI or Assistant Discipline Counsel). The Student was
provided with many opportunities to participate in the scheduling of the hearing in
this matter, including various indulgences either because the Student was out of

39688914.1
40839768.1

9

the country or because the Student was attempting to obtain counsel. Ultimately,
as set out below, the Student ceased all correspondence with Assistant Discipline
Counsel in May 2023.
10.

As a preliminary matter, we observe that the long period of time between when the
matter was first brought to the Student’s attention and the hearing was, in part, due
to the Student’s failure to send responding correspondence to SAI or Assistant
Discipline Counsel. As noted above, the Student often failed to respond to
correspondence from the University unless a strict date for response was provided.
However, we also note that there were long periods of time where Assistant
Discipline Counsel did not actively seek to continue to move this matter forward.
For example, while Assistant Discipline Counsel emailed the Student a disclosure
letter and disclosure brief on March 25, 2022 it was not until July 6, 2022 that
Assistant Discipline Counsel next communicated with the Student to schedule a
hearing date. As another example, Assistant Discipline Counsel and the Student
exchanged emails in September 2022 relating to the Student seeking
representation from Downtown Legal Services (“DLS”). On September 25, 2022,
the Student emailed Assistant Discipline Counsel to advise that she had not yet
heard back from DLS but would contact them on Monday. Notwithstanding the
Student’s failure to follow up with Assistant Discipline Counsel, there was no
further communication by Assistant Discipline Counsel to the Student until
February 1, 2023, when Assistant Discipline Counsel emailed the Student
requesting her availability for a hearing in this matter. We did not find that these
long periods of delay in Assistant Discipline Counsel’s correspondence with the
Student resulted in an absence of reasonable notice, but we do encourage
Assistant Discipline Counsel to be mindful of continuing to move matters forward
more diligently in the future.

11.

This matter was first brought to the Student’s attention on June 7, 2021, when she
was sent an email from SAI inviting her to attend a meeting with a Dean’s
Designate on June 21, 2021, to discuss the allegations that she had committed
academic offences in the Course. The Student advised on June 16, 2021, by email

39688914.1
40839768.1

10

that she would not be able to attend the meeting because she was not in Canada
and had work. The meeting was then rescheduled for August 19, 2021. The
Student again requested that the meeting be rescheduled by email on August 5,
2021, because she was not in Canada. SAI responded to the Student on August
16, 2021, advising that there would be one final opportunity for a meeting with the
Dean’s Designate in this matter, which would be scheduled in September 2021.
12.

The final meeting with the Dean’s Designate opportunity in this matter was
scheduled for November 18, 2021. SAI advised the Student of this final opportunity
by email on September 24, 2021. SAI’s September 24, 2021, email advised the
Student that if the Student did not respond by October 4, 2021 to confirm her
attendance the case against the Student would be forwarded to the Vice-Provost
for review. The Student did not respond by the deadline of October 4, 2021. As a
result, on November 15, 2021, SAI sent the Student an email advising that the
case against the Student was being forwarded to the Vice-Provost’s office. While
the Student corresponded by email with SAI on November 17, 2021, the case
against the Student had already been forwarded to the Vice-Provost’s Office. This
was reasonable in the circumstances.

13.

On January 22, 2022, the Student was served with the letter detailing the Charges
by e-mail sent by the Office of the Vice-Provost, Faculty and Academic Life to
c

.s

@mail.utoronto.ca, which was the e-mail address on file for the

Student in the University’s Repository of Student Information (“ROSI”). This was
the e-mail address that SAI used for its correspondence with the Student (and the
e-mail address the Student responded to SAI with). Later, on January 22, 2022,
the Appeals, Discipline and Faculty Grievances Office (the “ADFG Office”) sent the
Student an e-mail with the Charges, a copy of the Code, the Rules, and a pamphlet
with information on DLS, a legal aid clinic staffed by students at the University of
Toronto Faculty of Law.
14.

On February 2, 2022, Assistant Discipline Counsel sent an e-mail to the Student
at c

39688914.1
40839768.1

.s

@mail.utoronto.ca to introduce herself. This is the e-mail address

11

that Assistant Discipline Counsel used at all times to correspond with the Student,
subject to an exception noted below. The Student did not respond. On March 25,
2022, Assistant Discipline Counsel sent the Student a disclosure letter and
disclosure brief. The Student did not respond.
15.

On July 6, 2022, Assistant Discipline Counsel first emailed the Student to
coordinate scheduling a hearing in this matter. She requested a response from the
Student by July 13, 2022, failing which she would proceed to schedule the hearing
for a date that was convenient to the University and its witnesses. The Student
responded by e-mail using the e-mail address c

.s

@mail.utoronto.ca

indicating that she was available to attend a hearing on August 19, 2022 at 1:45
PM. The Student used this e-mail address to correspond with Assistant Discipline
Counsel in all cases, subject to an exception noted below. The Student also asked
in this email to speak with Assistant Discipline Counsel.
16.

The Student and Assistant Discipline Counsel had a without prejudice phone call
on July 13, 2022, where Assistant Discipline Counsel agreed to refrain from
scheduling a hearing until the Student had an opportunity to retain counsel. In
August and September 2022, Assistant Discipline Counsel and the Student
exchanged emails relating to the Student’s attempt to contact DLS. On September
25, 2022, the Student advised Assistant Discipline Counsel that she had not yet
heard from DLS but would contact them on Monday. The Student then failed to
respond to Assistant Discipline Counsel. Assistant Discipline Counsel then did not
contact the Student again for a period of four and a half months and only e-mailed
the Student again on February 1, 2023. There was no explanation in the evidence
for this delay.

17.

In her February 1, 2023, e-mail to the Student, Assistant Discipline Counsel
requested a response from the Student by February 8, 2023, failing which she
would proceed to schedule the hearing for a date that was convenient to the
University and its witnesses. On February 6, 2023, the Student e-mailed Assistant
Discipline Counsel advising, in part: “I’m a little bit confused now. My lawyer said

39688914.1
40839768.1

12

the case was been [sic] done. There’s no hearing. Didn’t he contact you? I sent
you an email at the end of October about his information.” Later, on February 6,
2023, the Student forwarded to Assistant Discipline Counsel a copy of an email
that the Student purportedly sent to Assistant Discipline Counsel on October 25,
2022. Unlike the other e-mails that the Student sent to Assistant Discipline
Counsel, this email was from

@qq.com and read, in part: “Still no [sic]

heard back from the Downtown Legal Services. I found another person who can
help me with my case. His name is Thomas Yang from Maple Master Service.”
18.

The e-mail address used in the Student’s October 25, 2022 e-mail to Assistant
Discipline Counsel was tinalie@paliareroland.com however Assistant Discipline
Counsel’s e-mail address is tina.lie@paliareroland.com. Evidence from a law clerk
at Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP indicates that emails sent to
tinalie@paliareroland.com return a bounce back undeliverable message. The law
clerk also gave evidence that she had been advised by Ms. Lie that she did not
receive the October 25, 2022 e-mail. We accept this evidence and find that
Assistant Discipline Counsel did not receive the October 25, 2022 e-mail.

19.

In February 2023 and March 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel and the Student
continued to exchange e-mails relating to the Student’s representative. Through
those e-mails, the Student advised that her representative Thomas Yang had
attempted to contact Assistant Discipline Counsel.

20.

On April 26, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel tried calling the phone number the
Student provided for her representative Thomas Yang but the phone number was
not in service. Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the Student later that day to
advise of this development. She requested a response from the Student by May
3, 2023, failing which she would proceed to schedule the hearing for a date that
was convenient to the University and its witnesses.

21.

On May 1, 2023, the Student e-mailed Assistant Discipline Counsel advising: “Just
talked with Thomas, he said he will sent [sic] you a copy of how he talked with
school tribunal office the result from the office of my case immediately.” On May 5,

39688914.1
40839768.1

13

2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the Student to advise “Your case
remains outstanding so we need to proceed to schedule the hearing” since she
had not heard from Thomas Yang. She asked the Student for her availability for a
hearing in the matter and advised that if the Student did not respond by May 10,
2023, she would proceed to schedule the hearing for a date that was convenient
to the University and its witnesses.
22.

On May 10, 2023, the Student responded to Assistant Discipline Counsel advising
that she had not been able to speak with Thomas Yang, because she was not in
Canada and due to time zone differences. The Student asked a number of
questions about the hearing. Assistant Discipline Counsel waited a month to
respond to these questions about the Tribunal’s processes and again asked the
Student for her availability for a hearing. The Student did not respond and ceased
all correspondence with Assistant Discipline Counsel at that time.

23.

On August 22, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the Student to advise
that they could not proceed to a hearing that summer but provided new hearing
dates. She requested a response from the Student by August 29, 2023, failing
which she would proceed to schedule the hearing for a date that was convenient
to the University and its witnesses. The Student did not respond.

24.

On September 27, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the Student to
advise that she would schedule a hearing for November 15, 2023, at 9:45 AM.
Assistant Discipline Counsel advised that if the Student did not attend, the hearing
may proceed in her absence. Later, on September 27, 2023, Assistant Discipline
Counsel e-mailed the ADFG Office requesting that a notice of virtual hearing be
issued for November 15, 2023, at 9:45 AM. The Student was copied on this e-mail.
The ADFG Office sent the Student an e-mail attaching the first Notice of Virtual
Hearing on September 27, 2023.

25.

Assistant Discipline Counsel made additional attempts to contact and serve the
Student as follows:

39688914.1
40839768.1

14

a) On October 20, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel attempted to
call the Student at the phone number in ROSI but the call went to
voicemail and Assistant Discipline Counsel left a message
requesting a return call.
b) On October 27, 2023, a law clerk at Paliare Roland e-mailed the
Student a letter from Assistant Discipline Counsel providing
information about the hearing along with the September 27, 2023
e-mail to the Student from the ADFG Office, the Charges, and
Assistant Discipline Counsel’s March 25, 2022 disclosure letter.
c) On October 27, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel attempted to
courier a package to the Student at the Student’s mailing address
in ROSI. The courier package contained the October 27, 2023
letter, the September 27, 2023 e-mail to the Student from the
ADFG Office, the Charges, and Assistant Discipline Counsel’s
March 25, 2022 disclosure letter. The courier company advised
Paliare Roland that the package was signed for by the concierge
of the building at the Student’s mailing address in ROSI.
d) On October 27, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel again
attempted to call the Student at the phone number in ROSI but the
call went to voicemail and Assistant Discipline Counsel left a
message requesting a return call. The voicemail also advised the
Student to check her e-mail as Assistant Discipline Counsel had
been trying to get in touch with her to discuss the hearing.
e) On October 31, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the
Student copies of the affidavits of the Provost’s witnesses advising
that the Provost would rely on them at the hearing.

39688914.1
40839768.1

15

f) On November 2, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel again
attempted to call the Student at the phone number in ROSI but
received a message that the call could not be completed.
g) On November 3, 2023, Assistant Discipline Counsel e-mailed the
Student

a

copy

of

the

October

27,

2023

letter

to

@qq.com and also sent the Student copies of the
September 27, 2023 ADFG Office e-mail, the Charges, and the
March 25, 2022 disclosure letter.
3.

The University filed an affidavit by an employee of its Information Technology
Services department, indicating that the University e-mail account was last
accessed on November 3, 2023, which was well after all of the attempts to provide
the Student with notice by e-mail were made (except the attempt at notice to the
other e-mail address used by the Student noted above in paragraph 25(g)).

26.

Whether or not the Student actually received the notice provided is not the question
we need to answer. The Student has an obligation to keep her information up to
date in ROSI and to check her e-mail. The Student’s failure to do so, or the failure
to respond, does not affect the validity of notice, which was reasonably provided
in this case in accordance with the Tribunal’s Rules. The Student was active in
corresponding with SAI and with Assistant Discipline Counsel until May 2023 at
which point she ceased her correspondence without any explanation. We find this
was a choice with consequences and therefore the Tribunal ordered that the
hearing should proceed in the Student’s absence.

27.

As a Panel, we also turned our minds to the question of whether or not Assistant
Discipline Counsel was obligated under the Law Society of Ontario’s Rules of
Professional Conduct to cease communicating directly with the Student after
February 6, 2023, when the Student advised that she was represented by Thomas
Yang. We accept Assistant Discipline Counsel’s evidence that she unsuccessfully
attempted to contact Thomas Yang by telephone using the phone number provided
by the Student and that she searched the Law Society of Ontario’s Lawyer and

39688914.1
40839768.1

16

Paralegal directory and did not receive any indication that Mr. Yang was a lawyer
or paralegal. She also googled “Maple Master Service” and was not able to find
anything relevant. We are satisfied that Assistant Discipline Counsel met any
obligations owed under the Rules of Professional Conduct in the circumstances.
We make no findings in respect of whether Thomas Yang was a fiction.

The following summarizes our reasons for concluding that the Student violated the
Code and therefore committed an offence.

29.

The Student was enrolled in MAT301H1Y (the “Course”) in the summer of 2020.
The instructors for the Course were Matt Olechnowicz and Shuyang Shen.

30.

The Course is a third-year undergraduate level math course about group theory, a
branch of abstract algebra. The Course was taught online due to the COVID-19
pandemic.

31.

The Course syllabus brought the Code to students’ attention and outlined
behaviours that constitute academic misconduct. Matt Olechnowicz advised
students of academic integrity during the first lecture in the Course.

32.

The grading scheme for the Course required that students submit several
assessments for credit, including:
a) Six homework assignments. Each homework assignment was
worth 8% of the final mark in the Course, with each student’s lowest
scoring homework assignment being dropped;
b) 24 quizzes. Each quiz was worth 1% of the final mark in the Course,
with only the 20 highest quiz scores counting towards a student’s
final mark; and
c) A final test. This was a take-home, open book examination that was
worth 15% of the final mark in the Course. As part of the final test,

17

the Student completed and signed an academic integrity
declaration that read, in part: “I vow to complete this exam
individually, neither accessing nor requesting access to any
unauthorized aid, and neither providing assistance to nor seeking
assistance from any other individual.” The first page of the test
advised students that it was to be written individually.
33.

Students were required to complete each of these assessments independently.

34.

In this case, our review of the evidence establishes on a balance of probabilities
that the Student had access to a subscription-based website called Chegg. Chegg
allows students to post problems to the site, which are then answered by so-called
“experts”. Subscribers are able to access the questions and answers posted by
others on the site.
i. Homework Assignments (1-3, 5-6)

35.

The Panel has reviewed the evidence and concluded that the Student is guilty on
a balance of probabilities for plagiarism contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the Code in
respect of homework assignments (1-3 and 5-6).

36.

The Student’s answers to these homework assignments contain highly similar
answers that were posted on Chegg in response to questions from assignments in
the course (the “Chegg Answers”) in that the Student’s answers are highly similar
in structure, notation and method. There were also many suspicious similarities
between the Student’s answers in these homework assignments and the Chegg
Answers. The Provost provided evidence of comparisons between the Student’s
answers and the Chegg Answers for these homework assignments (at Exhibits G,
K, O, U, and Y to Matt Olechnowicz’s affidavit), which establish, on a balance of
probabilities, that the Student knowingly represented as their own an idea or
expression of an idea or work of another, contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the Code.
ii. Homework Assignment (4)

39688914.1
40839768.1

18

37.

The Panel has reviewed the evidence and concluded that the Student is guilty on
a balance of probabilities for obtaining unauthorized assistance contrary to section
B.I.1(b) of the Code in respect of homework assignment (4).

38.

While there were no suspicious similarities between the Student’s answers in this
homework assignment and the Chegg Answers, the evidence establishes on a
balance of probabilities that the Student viewed several Chegg Answers before the
Student submitted homework assignment (4). In so doing, we find the Student
knowingly obtained assistance in connection with homework assignment (4), even
if she did not incorporate any of the Chegg Answers into her own answers, contrary
to section B.I.1(b) of the Code.
iii. Quizzes (1, 3-24)

39.

On September 10, 2020, Matt Olechnowicz met with another student enrolled in
the Course (“D.Z.”) to discuss an allegation that he had committed academic
offences on assessments in the Course. During that meeting, D.Z. claimed that he
had copied his answers to homework assignment (4) from the Student. The
answers did not match, so Mr. Olechnowicz suspected that D.Z. was not being
honest. Mr. Olechnowicz remained concerned that D.Z. and the Student may have
improperly collaborated on other assessments in the Course, so he compared all
of D.Z.’s assessments to those of the Student.

40.

The results of Mr. Olechnowicz’s review indicated the following unusual similarities
between the quizzes (1, 3-24) of the Student’s and the quizzes (1, 3-24) of D.Z.:
a) the vast majority of both students’ quizzes were submitted at very
similar times within the 24-hour submission window (a chart of
these similarities is set out at Exhibit VV to Matt Olechnowicz’s
affidavit);
b) the vast majority of both students’ quizzes obtained similar scores,
often submitting the same incorrect answers – both students

39688914.1
40839768.1

19

obtained an identical score and submitted identical incorrect
answers for quizzes 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 22;
c) on quizzes 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, and 23 the students
completed difficult questions almost instantaneously; and
d) D.Z. later admitted to collaborating on the quizzes with the Student.
41.

In respect of this evidence, we noted that the only evidence tendered by the
Provost in connection with quizzes 1 and 21 was the admission by D.Z. as to his
collaboration with the Student. None of the other suspicious circumstantial
evidence existed in respect of quizzes 1 and 21.

42.

The Panel has reviewed the above evidence and concluded that the Student is
guilty on a balance of probabilities for unauthorized assistance contrary to section
B.I.1(b) of the Code in respect of quizzes (3-20, 22-24). There was no
circumstantial evidence to establish any unauthorized assistance in respect of
quizzes (1, 21) and therefore the Panel concluded that the Student was not guilty
on a balance of probabilities for unauthorized assistance contrary to section
B.I.1(b) of the Code in respect of quizzes (1, 21).
iv. Final test

43.

The final test was posted on August 20, 2020, and was due on August 24, 2020.
We find the Student guilty on a balance of probabilities for plagiarism contrary to
section B.I.1(d) of the Code.

44.

The Student’s answers to numerous questions on the final test contain unusual
similarities to Chegg Answers to the same questions. The Provost provided
evidence of comparisons between the Student’s answers and the Chegg Answers
for the final test (at Exhibit DD to Matt Olechnowicz’s affidavit), which establish, on
a balance of probabilities, that the Student knowingly represented as their own an
idea or expression of an idea or work of another, contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the
Code.

D. Sanction

46.

The Provost sought an order imposing the following sanctions on the Student:
a) a final grade of zero in MAT301H1Y;
b) a suspension from the University for four years from the date of the
Tribunal’s order;
c) a notation of the sanction on the Student’s academic record and
transcript for five years from the date of the Tribunal’s order; and
d) the case be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the name of
the Student withheld.

47.

In determining the sanction, the Tribunal has considered the factors set out in the
decision University of Toronto and Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3, November 5,
1976). This is the leading decision on sentencing principles. We discuss below
some of the important factors we think are relevant to the Student’s circumstances
in this case and that weigh in our determination on the appropriate sanction.

48.

Counsel for the Provost submitted a book of authorities and referred to several
cases in argument in addition to the Mr. C. case. In particular, we were taken to
the cases of University of Toronto and B.S. (Case No. 697, January 17, 2014),
University of Toronto and S.P. (Case No. 1276, May 16, 2022), and University of
Toronto and S.E.C. (Case No. 1215, January 13, 2022), in which the students were
found to have committed similar academic offences to the Student in this case.

49.

Here, the Student did not participate in a Dean’s Designate meeting, nor did she
attend the hearing. While the Student is under no obligation to participate or attend,
her failure to do so is relevant because we are left without any evidence of remorse.

39688914.1
40839768.1

21

Nor is there any evidence that the Student has attempted to take responsibility for
her conduct. While a decision not to participate at a hearing is not necessarily an
aggravating factor, we find that in the circumstances we have no evidence that a
more lenient sanction should be imposed in this matter on the basis of the
Student’s character. Because the Student did not attend the hearing, there was no
evidence of any mitigating circumstances in this matter.
50.

On the issue of whether the Student attempted to delay or frustrate this matter, we
do not accept Assistant Discipline Counsel’s submissions that the evidence
establishes such an aggravating factor. While the pattern of correspondence with
the Student and SAI as well as Assistant Discipline Counsel demonstrates that the
Student either failed to respond or would only respond shortly before, or on, a
deadline provided by SAI or Assistant Discipline Counsel, we do not accept that
this pattern establishes that the Student was expressly attempting to delay or
frustrate this matter. Moreover, we have not made any findings on whether
Thomas Yang was fictitious and while we accept that Assistant Discipline Counsel
did not receive the October 25, 2022 email sent to tinalie@paliareroland.com, we
also find that there was an unexplained and unreasonably lengthy delay on
Assistant Discipline Counsel’s part in attempting to communicate with the Student
between September 2022 and February 2023.

51.

In respect of aggravating factors that were established on the evidence, we find
that there is a likelihood of repetition given the number of offences in this matter
and that very significant time and resources were required to prepare for the
hearing in this matter as a result of the Student’s failure to participate at virtually
all stages in the process.

52.

As a final matter, the Panel considered the sanction imposed on D.Z. While he was
alleged to have committed many of the same offences as the Student, he did not
receive a suspension. D.Z. participated in a Dean’s Designate meeting on
February 23, 2022, and admitted guilt in respect of certain offences with which he
was charged. At that meeting, he was sanctioned with a final grade of zero in the

39688914.1
40839768.1

22

Course and a notation on his academic record and transcript from February 23,
2022, until April 30, 2023.
53.

We considered a recent case of the Discipline Appeals Board in University of
Toronto and X.M. (Case No. 1388, September 12, 2023) where the Discipline
Appeals Board explained certain principles that ought to apply in sanctioning two
(or more) students who are found guilty of the same offences. In the X.M. decision,
the Discipline Appeals Board acknowledged that “a sanction imposed at the end
of a contested hearing will almost always be more serious, frequently significantly
so, than the sanction that would have been imposed had a student acknowledged
the offence immediately.” However, the Discipline Appeals Board also explained
the importance of ensuring “a rational relationship, connected to the reasons for
imposing a more serious sanction, between the sanctions imposed on a student
who immediately admits an offence, and one who unsuccessfully contests it.”

54.

In the circumstances of this case, particularly where the Panel did not accept the
Provost’s submissions on certain aggravating factors, having regard to the
sanction imposed on D.Z. and based on its review of similar cases presented by
Assistant Discipline Counsel, which are not binding on us but are useful in ensuring
that the Tribunal renders decisions that are consistent, the Panel made the
following order:
a) The Student is guilty of:

i.

knowingly representing as their own an idea or expression of an idea
or work of another in five homework assignments and a final test that
they submitted in MAT301H1Y, contrary to section B.I.1(d) of the
Code; and

ii.

knowingly obtaining unauthorized assistance in one homework
assignment (4) and 21 quizzes (3-20, 22-24) they submitted in

39688914.1
40839768.1

23

MAT301H1Y, contrary to section B.I.1(b) of the Code.

b) The following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:

i.

a final grade of zero in the course MAT301H1Y in summer 2020;

ii.

a suspension from the University of Toronto for a period of three
years, commencing on November 15, 2023, the date of the
Tribunal’s Order; and

iii.

a notation of the sanction on the Student’s academic record and
transcript for a period of four years commencing on November 15,
2023, the date of the Tribunal’s Order.

c) This case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the name of the
Student withheld.
Dated at Toronto, this 27th day of February 2024,

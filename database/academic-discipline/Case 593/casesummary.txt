   Student charged with six offences under s. B.I.3(a), s. B.I.3(b) and s.
   B.I.1(a) of the Code. The charges related to the allegations that the
   Student altered his academic record, misrepresented his academic
   standing on an application to a summer research program, and
   misrepresented his academic standing on his rÃ©sumÃ©. The falsified
   academic record included misrepresented grades, incorrect credit
   requirements, and misrepresented sessional, cumulative, and annual
   grade point averages. In support of the falsified academic record, the
   Student included a resumÃ© incorrectly stating that he had been placed
   on the Deanâs list in each year of the Studentâs study. The Student and
   the University submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts. Pursuant to the
   Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student pleaded guilty to five charges:
   one charge under s. B.I.3(a), two charges under s. B.I.3(b), and two
   charges under s. B.I.1(a). The University agreed that, if the Panel
   convicted the Student of three charges, specifically, the two charges
   under s. B.I.1.(a) and the charge under s. B.I.3(a), they would
   withdraw the remaining charges. The Panel reviewed the Agreed Statement
   of Facts and found the Student guilty of three offences under s.
   B.I.1.(a) and s. B.I.3(a) and agreed to accept the guilty pleas in
   respect to those charges. The remaining charges were withdrawn. The
   University Submission on Penalty suggested a five year suspension, a
   recommendation of expulsion, and that the case be reported to the
   Provost. The Student characterized the University Submission on Penalty
   as excessively harsh and argued a significant suspension would be more
   appropriate. Drawing on the Sopinka principles as articulated in the
   case The University of Toronto and Mr. C., the Panel concluded the
   sanction sought by the University was appropriate. The Panel
   articulated concern about the seriousness of the Studentâs offences.
   The Panel held that forging or falsifying academic history was among
   the most serious offences a student can commit as the Universityâs
   reputation hinges on the reliability of its official records. The Panel
   noted the scope of the offences, a total of 56 changes to the academic
   record, as significant. The Panel further noted that the acts entailed
   a subjective intention and obvious planning. The offences took place
   over a period of time and did not result from a single, ill-advised
   decision. The offences further took place as part of an effort to
   obtain an advantage in applying to a University program, damaging the
   University and other students. The Panel noted that the University
   Submission on Penalty would serve as a deterrence to others who may
   contemplate similar actions. Finally, the Panel found no evidence of
   extenuating circumstances. The Panel noted that the Student cooperated
   with the Tribunal process, entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts,
   and characterized his actions as wrong but found that these factors
   alone did not warrant a mitigated penalty. The Panel noted that the
   Student seemed primarily concerned with rehabilitating his academic
   career and was not concerned with the seriousness of the offences. The
   Panel concluded that the University Submission on Penalty was
   appropriate and imposed a five-year suspension, a recommendation to the
   President that the Student be expelled from the University, and that a
   report to the Provost be issued.

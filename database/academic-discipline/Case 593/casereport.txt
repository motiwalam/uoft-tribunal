Mr. D

was presen(at the hearing. He was not represented by counsel.

AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS & FINDING OF GUILT
[4]

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the University had entered into
an Agreed Statement of Facts with Mr. D . That document is attached as Appendix A
to this decision. Pursuant to that Agreed Statement of Facts, Mr. D
pleaded guilty to
charges 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The University agreed that, if the Tribunal convicted Mr. D
on charges 1, 3, and 5, then the University would withdraw charges 2, 4, and 6.

[5]

After reviewing tl1e facts contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Tribunal
deliberated and concluded that the facts form the foundation for a finding of guilt on
chm·ges 1, 3, and 5, and agreed to accept the guilty pleas in respect of those charges.

5

SANCTION
[6)

The University argued that the appropriate sanctiot) in this matter was:
(a) that Mr. D
be suspended from the University commencing July 2~, 20 l 0, for a
period not to exceed 5 years;
(b) that the Tribunal recommends to the President of the University that he· recommend to
the Governing Council that Mr. D
be expelled from the University; and
(c) that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of·the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanction imposed, with Mr. D .'s name
withheld.

[7]

Mr. D 's view was that the penalty sought by the University is "excessively harsh" and
that a significant suspension would be more appropriate.

[8]

The Tribunal considered the University's submissions, as well as those of Mr. D . The
Tribunal weighed the principles that govern its decisions regarding sanction, as outlined
in the reasons for decision of Mr. Sopitlka, as he then was, in The University oJToronto
and Mr. C., dated November 5, 1976. Based on those principles, for the reasons set out
below, the Tribunal concluded that the sanction sought by the University was appropriate
in the circumstances of this case.

[9]

The Tribunal is particularly concerned about the nature of the offences. The offences to
which Mr. D
has admitted are clearly serious. Forging or falsifying an academic
history is, in particular, among the most serious offences a student can commit. The
University's reputation and credibility hinge on the reliability of its official records. The
forgery or falsification of an application to a university research program, and a resume
submitted in support of that application, are also extremely serious offences. The sheer
scope of the offences - 56 changes to the academic record, for instance - is significant.

[10]

The Tribunal also notes that these are acts that entailed a subjective intention and obvious
planning. They took place over a period of time. They are not acts that could result from
inadvertence or even a single, "spur of the moment" ill-advised decision.

[ 11)

Moreover, the offences took place as pmi of an effort to obtain an advantage when
applying to a summer research program at the University. This is detrimental both to the
U11iversity and to other students. Mr. D
also abused the trust of Dr. Hare, who
suppoited his application based on false information.

[ 12]

The detriment to the University occasioned by these offences is grave, and clear.
Offences such as these undermine .the ability of the public to put stock in credentials
issued by the University. As noted above, the University's reputation and credibility
hinge on the reliability of its records.

6

[ 13J

The Tribunal also finds that the principal of general deterrence is supported by granting
the sanction sought by the University, Such a penalty will serve as a deterrent to others
who may contemplate similar actions.

( 14]

Finally, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence of any extenuating circumstances that
would suggest that a lessened penalty might be appropriate. Mr. D
is certainly to be
commended for cooperating with t~is process and entering ,into an Agreed Statement of
Facts, He also did, to his credit, characterize his conduct as "wrong", However, these
facts in 'themselves do not warrant a mitigated penalty. Mr, D 's submissions lo the
Tribunal suggest that his concern is p.imarily with rehabilitating his own academic career
and reputation, and that he does not appreciate the seriousness of his offences or the harm
his offences have occasioned the University and his fellow students, In these
circumstances, the Tribunal concludes _that there is no evidence of extenuating
circumstances that would urge in favour of a less severe penalty.

[ 15]

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the sanction sought by the University is
appropriate. An Order to this effect has been issued.

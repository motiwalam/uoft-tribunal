   Trial Division - s. B.i.l(d) of Code ‚ plagiarism - two papers
   plagiarized from internet ‚ drafts submitted in error - testimony not
   credible ‚ no corroborative evidence - conduct inconsistent with
   version of events - implausible version of events - guilty plea to
   prior plagiarism offence admissible as to credibility - claim of
   unfamiliarity with disciplinary process supportive of negative findings
   on credibility ‚ finding of guilt ‚ request that publication be denied
   due to public image - previous rehabilitation opportunity squandered ‚
   no demonstration of guilt or remorse - further dishonest academic acts
   likely should return to University be allowed before significant
   opportunity to reflect - strong message required due to nature of
   offence and seniority of student ‚ appreciation of gravity of conduct
   improved by four-year notation - no risk of disclosure of identity
   given anonymity requirement of publication - grade assignment of zero

   transcript; and report to Provost
   Student charged with two offences under s. B.i.1(d), and alternatively,
   two offences under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code. The charges related to
   allegations that the Student submitted two papers, in two courses, each
   of which contained passages plagiarized from the internet. The Panel
   considered versions of the papers and the Student‚s testimony
   acknowledging that the phrases were authored by others. The Panel found
   that the Student was familiar with the principle of plagiarism and that
   it was reasonable to infer that information warning against plagiarism
   was made available to her. The Panel considered the evidence and found
   that the Student‚s testimony that drafts of the papers were submitted
   in error to not be credible. The Panel found that there was no
   corroborative evidence to support the claim that a final version
   existed at the time the papers were submitted. The Panel found that the
   Student‚s conduct was inconsistent with her version of events and that
   her overall version of events was implausible. The Panel noted that the
   Student‚s guilty plea to a prior plagiarism charge was admissible as to
   her credibility. The Panel found that the Student‚s claim to being
   unfamiliar with the disciplinary process was supportive of its negative
   findings on the Student‚s credibility on other grounds. The Panel
   stated that the evidence strongly suggested the Student fabricated the
   evidence which she submitted to the Tribunal in response to the
   charges, however it was not necessary to make a specific finding on the
   issue. The Panel found that the charges were proven on clear and
   convincing evidence. The Student asked that publication of the matter
   be denied because of her public, television image. The Panel found that
   three criteria, and the absence of any mitigating factors, called for a
   serious penalty. Firstly, it was not the Student‚s first offence and
   she had squandered the opportunity for rehabilitation. Secondly, the
   Student did not acknowledge her guilt and did not demonstrate remorse
   or an appreciation of the wrongfulness or seriousness of her acts, and
   there was a considerable likelihood that the Student would commit
   further dishonest academic acts should she return to the University
   before having a significant opportunity to reflect on the matter.
   Thirdly, the nature of the offence and the fact that the Student was a
   senior student required that a strong message be sent that such
   behavior would not be tolerated. The Panel considered previous Tribunal
   decisions and found that a two-year suspension was inadequate to
   address the three criteria and that a five-year suspension was too
   long, as it was reserved for more serious offences. The Panel found
   that a four-year notation would improve the chances that the Student
   would come to appreciate the gravity of her conduct. The Panel found
   that it was appropriate and important to publish notice of the
   decision, and that given the anonymity requirement, there was no risk
   to the disclosure of the Student‚s identity. The Panel imposed a grade
   of zero in the two courses; a three-year suspension; a four-year
   notation on the Student‚s academic record and transcript; and that a
   report be issued to the Provost.

   The Student was charged with respect to academic offences in two
   separate courses. Charges pertaining to the first course, (‚MAT334‚),
   are as follows. The Student was charged with knowingly representing as
   her own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another in term
   test 1, contrary to s. B.i.1(d)) of the Code. In the alternative, the
   Student was charged under s. B.i.1(b) of the Code for knowingly using
   or possessing an unauthorized assistance in connection with term test
   1. In the alternative, the Student was charged with knowingly engaging
   in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to
   obtain academic advantage in connection with term test 1 contrary to s.
   B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   Charges pertaining to the second course, (the ‚ECO Course‚), are as
   follows. The Student was charged with knowingly obtaining and or
   providing unauthorized assistance in connection with two term tests in
   the ECO Course contrary to s. B.i.1(b). In the alternative, the Student
   was charged under s. B.i.1(d) for knowingly representing as her own an
   idea or expression of an idea or work of another in connection with two
   term tests in the ECO Course. In the further alternative, the Student
   was charged under s. B.i.3(b) with knowingly engaging in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
   not otherwise described in the Code to obtain academic advantage in
   connection with two ECO Course term tests.

   In Fall 2021, the Student enrolled in MAT334. Students in the course
   were required to write two term tests and prohibited from using or
   receiving any aids. The Student‚s submission for term test 1 was
   substantially similar to the answers given by a number of other
   students in the course. The Student‚s answers and those of another
   student had verbatim similarities and non-verbatim conceptual
   similarities, including the use of an advanced theorem that had not
   been taught in the course lectures. The answers were correct, but the
   degree of similarities was striking given the many ways other students
   in the course answered the questions.

   In Fall 2020 and Winter 2021, the Student was enrolled in the ECO
   course. Students in the Course were required to write four term tests,
   each administered online. Students were not permitted to collaborate or
   use aids. The Student‚s answers for term test 2 and term test 3 were
   substantially similar to answers provided by other students in the
   Course. The Student‚s term test 2 answers included striking
   similarities and in certain instances were virtually identical those of
   another student. The Student‚s term test 3 answers were also strikingly
   similar and in certain instances virtually identical.

   The Student did not attend the hearing and was not represented by
   counsel. The Panel heard evidence that the University had made serious
   efforts to serve the Student with notice via email, telephone, and
   courier. The Panel found that reasonable notice of the hearing was
   provided according to the University Tribunal‚s Rules of Practice and
   Procedure and the Statutory Powers Procedure Act .

   The Assistant Discipline Counsel made submissions that where the
   University leads evidence that a student‚s answer is similar to
   another‚s, the Panel should consider the nature of the question, the
   nature of the similarities, the degree of the similarities, the
   student‚s explanation, and any other relevant factors. Applying this
   submitted framework to the Student‚s charges, the Panel was satisfied
   that the evidence established that the University proved on a balance
   of probabilities the facts to support a conviction on the MAT334 and
   ECO Course charges under s. B.i.1(b).

   In determining the sanctions, the Panel considered the University‚s
   submission that given that the Student did not participate in the
   proceedings, there was no evidence presented regarding character or
   mitigating circumstances. With respect to the likelihood of repetition
   of offence, while the Student had no prior offences, she had committed
   three concurrent offences suggested to the Panel there was a real
   likelihood of re-offence. With respect to deterrence, the Panel echoed
   a previous case and posited that there is a strong need to deter others
   from committing a similar offence as this offence poses a threat to the
   University‚s integrity and reputation. After deliberation, the Panel
   accepted the University submission on sanctions.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a final grade of zero in
   both courses; a suspension from the University for a period of three
   years; a notation of the sanction on the Student‚s academic record for
   a period of four years, and a report to the Provost for publication.

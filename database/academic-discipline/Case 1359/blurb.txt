Trial Division – s. B.i.1(d) – plagiarism – Student admitted to purchasing the essay they submitted for academic credit in the course – Agreed Statement of Fact (“ASF”) – guilty plea accepted – Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”) – the admission of wrongdoing came early on which showed insight and remorse – serious nature of the offence – the detriment to the University – A strong need to deter others from committing a similar offence as this type of offence poses a grave threat to the integrity of the University’s processes for evaluating students, is profoundly unfair to other students, and jeopardizes the University’s reputation – the Student was experiencing mental health issues and several personal and family challenges, some of which were brought on or exacerbated by the COVID pandemic – the JSP was reasonable – a grade of zero in the course; a four-year suspension; a five-year notation on the transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

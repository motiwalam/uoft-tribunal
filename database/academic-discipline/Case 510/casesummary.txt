   of the Code. The charges related to allegations that the Student
   submitted an altered Transcript of Consolidated Academic Record to her
   employer which falsified marks received for University courses, added
   courses not taken and deleted courses that had been taken,
   misrepresented her GPA, and misrepresented that she had obtained a
   Bachelor of Arts degree. The Student pleaded guilty to the charge under
   s. B.i.3(a). The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts and
   Joint Submission on Penalty. Based on the Agreed Statement of Facts,
   the Panel accepted the guilty plea. The Panel considered the Joint
   Submission on Penalty and the fact that both parties had spoken in
   support of it, and accepted the jointly submitted sanction. The Panel
   imposed a recommendation to the President, further to s. C.ii.(b)(i) of
   the Code, that the Student be expelled from the University; a
   suspension of up to five-years pending the expulsion decision; and that
   a report be issued to the Provost.

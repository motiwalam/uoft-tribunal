   HEARING DATE: September 16, 2021, via Zoom

   Panel Members:
   Ms. Erin Dann, Chair
   Professor Glen Jones, Faculty Panel Member
   Ms. Madison Kerr, Student Panel Member

   Appearances:
   Mr. Robert Centa, Assistant Discipline Counsel, Paliare Roland

   Not in Attendance:

   Hearing Secretary:

   Discipline and Faculty Grievances

   The Student was charged underÂ s. B.i.1(d) of theâ¯Code of Behaviour on
   Academic Matters, 1995â¯(the âCodeâ) on the basis thatÂ the
   StudentÂ knowinglyÂ represented as her own an idea or expression of an
   idea and/or the work of another inÂ aÂ research paper.Â In the
   alternative, the Student was charged underÂ s.Â B.i.3(b)Â of the Code
   on the basis that the StudentÂ knowingly engaged in a form of cheating,
   academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not
   otherwise described in the CodeÂ in order toÂ obtain academic credit or
   other academic advantage of any kind in connection withÂ aÂ research
   paper.

   The StudentÂ did notÂ appear atÂ the hearingÂ but corresponded with
   Assistant Discipline CounselÂ prior to theÂ hearing andÂ requested that
   the hearingÂ be conductedÂ in her absence.Â TheÂ parties were able to
   reach an agreement and the hearing proceededÂ onÂ the basis
   ofÂ anÂ Agreed Statement of Facts (âASFâ) and a Joint Submission on
   Penalty (âJSPâ).Â The Panel noted thatÂ pursuant to ss. 6 and 7 of
   theÂ Statutory Powers Procedure ActÂ (âSPPAâ), and rule 17 of the
   University TribunalÂ Rules of Practice and Procedure, where reasonable
   notice of an oral hearing was given to a party in accordance with
   theÂ SPPA andÂ the party does not attend, the Tribunal may proceed in
   theÂ absence of the party, and the party is not entitled to any further
   notice of the proceeding.Â The Panel further noted that the ASF
   outlined that the StudentÂ acknowledged receiving notice of the hearing
   and requested that it proceed in her absence.Â Furthermore,Â the ASF
   outlined that the StudentÂ was aware that the Tribunal may find her
   guilty of academic misconduct and may impose a penalty greater than
   that set out in the joint submission on penalty.Â Given the joint
   request of the University and the Student, the Panel exercised its
   direction to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the Student.

   Regarding the charge laid under s. B.i.1(d) of the Code,Â the Panel
   noted that the ASF outlinedÂ thatÂ Turnitin.comÂ detected that the
   StudentâsÂ research paperÂ included several verbatim and nearly
   verbatim passages from two sourcesÂ without proper citation or
   attribution. The ASF furthered by outlining thatÂ the Professor who
   taught the course for which the research paper in question was
   submittedÂ reviewed the paper and the two sources. Upon review, the
   Professor determined that the Student had included several verbatim and
   nearly verbatim passagesÂ from the sources in herÂ research
   paperÂ without proper citation or attribution.Â TheÂ Panel noted that
   the StudentÂ acknowledged in the ASF that she committed plagiarism when
   she submitted her researchÂ paper without properÂ citation
   orÂ attribution.Â Based on the StudentâsÂ admissions,Â the ASF, and the
   supporting materials, the PanelÂ concludedÂ that there was clear and
   convincing evidence, on a balance of probabilities,Â that
   theÂ plagiarismÂ chargeÂ hasÂ been proven and it accepted the Studentâs
   guiltyÂ plea with respect to that charge.Â Given this finding, the
   University withdrew theÂ alternativeÂ charge.

   The Panel consideredÂ the JSP submitted jointly by the Student and the
   University. The Panel noted,Â absent exceptional circumstances, panels
   are expected to accept and implementÂ a joint submission. As set out in
   the Discipline Appeals Board decision inÂ The University of Toronto and
   M. A. (Case No. 837, December 22, 2016), a joint submission on penalty
   may be rejected by a panel only in circumstances where to give effect
   to it would be contrary to the public interest or would bring the
   administration of justice into disrepute.Â In this case, it was the
   Panelâs view that the joint submissionÂ was neither contraryÂ to the
   public interest, nor would it bring the administration of justice into
   disrepute.Â Â InÂ arriving at this decision, the Panel considered the
   nature of the offence, the detriment to the University occasioned by
   the offence, the need to deter other students, the character of the
   Student, and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
   offence.Â The Panel noted thatÂ plagiarism is a serious offence that
   diminishes the relationship of trust between the UniversityÂ and its
   students, and itÂ undermines the evaluative process fundamental to the
   academic setting.Â The Panel furtherÂ considered that the Student
   hadÂ two prior plagiarism offences and therefore,Â the failure to
   properly reference the sources inÂ the researchÂ paper could not be
   characterized as a one-time lapse in judgment.Â The PanelÂ also
   considered theÂ mitigating factors; the Panel noted that
   theÂ StudentÂ admitted guilt andÂ entered intoÂ an ASF and JSP which
   demonstratedÂ insight and remorse, andÂ thatÂ the Student was
   experiencingÂ health issues at the time of the offence. In
   consideration of all the circumstances, and the relevant cases provided
   by the parties in support of the JSP, the PanelÂ accepted the JSP.Â The
   PanelÂ imposedÂ the following sanctions:Â a final grade of zero in the
   course;Â aÂ three-yearÂ suspension;Â aÂ four-yearÂ notation on
   transcript; andÂ aÂ report to the Provost for publication.

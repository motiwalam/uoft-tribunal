   Mr. Jamon Camisso, Student Member
   Appearances:
   Mr. Robert Centa, Assistant Discipline Counsel for the University

   Trial Division â plagiarism â concocting references â course work â
   hearing not attended â agreed statement of facts â joint submission on
   penalty â agreed statement of facts and joint submission on penalty
   accepted â finding of guilt â prior offences - grade of zero in course;
   4 year suspension; 5 year notation on transcript; and report to Provost
   with name of Student withheld

   The Student was charged under the Code. The Student plead guilty to the
   charges and an Agreed Statement of Facts and a Joint Submission on
   penalty were presented to the Panel. The Panel accepted the above and
   imposed a penalty of a grade of zero in POL 442, a four year
   suspension, a 5 year transcript notation, and a report to the Provost.
   The Panel noted that it was a clear case of plagiarism and that the
   student admitted concocting references. The Panel noted sanctioning
   principles in Mr. C (1976-1977); namely, that the student accepted
   responsibility, that there were not mitigating factors given that the
   Student did not attend the hearing, and that the Student had two prior
   offences. The Panel considered University of Toronto and MHH, where the
   Panel noted the seriousness of the offence of plagiarism. The Panel
   noted the harm caused to the University ( University of Toronto and SB
   , November 2007).

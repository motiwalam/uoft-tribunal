   The Student

   The Trial Division of the Tribunal held a hearing on October 22, 2013
   to consider charges brought by the University against the Student under
   the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters . The Student did not attend
   the hearing but the University produced an affidavit establishing that
   the Student had received reasonable notice. The Tribunal determined
   that it was appropriate to proceed.

   Student charged with six offences under s. B.i.1(a) and, in the
   alternative, one charge under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code . The charges
   related to allegations that the student had falsified several
   documents, namely one personal statement and five University of Toronto
   Student Medical Certificates, in support of a request for academic
   accommodation.

   The University called one witness, the Registrar at St. Michaelâs
   College. The Witness explained that he had received a petition form and
   supporting letter, required documents to obtain accommodation, to defer
   a final exam and further defer two exams for which a deferral had
   already been granted from the Student. The documents described the
   Studentâs illness and were signed by a doctor. The Witness reviewed and
   forwarded the documents to the central office of the Faculty of Arts
   and Science who refused the Studentâs petition as the dates of the
   exams were âunreasonably apart.â The Witness received a petition for
   appeal from the Student five months later consisting of a completed
   petition form, an Absent Declaration letter and several University of
   Toronto Student Medical Certificates, four signed by a doctor in
   Toronto and one by doctor in New York. The Witness noticed
   inconsistencies between the petition and appeal documents with the
   number of physicians visited, dates the Medical Certificates were
   signed and language and writing style used by the doctors. The Witness
   was suspicious and researched both doctors who had allegedly signed the
   certificates. He found that the Toronto doctor did not exist and the
   New York doctor had never met the Student. The Witness emailed the
   Student expressing his belief that the certificates were ânot
   legitimate.â The Panel accepted the Witnessâ evidence as to the
   information obtained as a result of his investigation but attached no
   weight to his personal views as to whether the certificates were
   falsified.

   The Panel found that the five medical certificates were falsified
   within the meaning of s. B.i.1(a) of the Code and that the Student
   knowingly engaged in a form of fraud or misrepresentation contrary to
   s. B.i.3(b) of the Code in submitting the âAbsent Declaration letter.â
   The Panel noted that the misrepresentations included the number of
   times he had seen a physician and attaching certificates with falsified
   information. The University argued that the misrepresentations in the
   letter fell under s. B.i.1(a) however the letter itself was not forged,
   rather the information it contained was falsified.

   The University sought a penalty including a grade of zero in the three
   courses, a recommendation of expulsion, a suspension of five years and
   that the matter be reported to the Provost. The Panel looked to the
   principles and factors described in University of Toronto and Mr. C.
   (November 5, 1976/77-3) in considering the appropriate penalty. Little
   was known about the Studentâs character, save that he did not appear at
   the hearing and showed no signs of remorse. While it was the Studentâs
   first offence it was very serious and the Panel was not aware of any
   extenuating circumstances. The Panel also weighed the detriment to the
   University and the need to deter others from committing the same
   offence. Â The Panel considered several cases in which the penalty for
   forging medical documents was expulsion. There were some forgery cases
   in which a five year suspension was imposed, but the Panel noted that
   in those cases the students had admitted their guilt.

   The Panel assigned a grade of zero in the three courses at issue,
   recommended that the Student be expelled from the University, imposed a
   five-year suspension and ordered that the case be reported to the
   Provost for publication.

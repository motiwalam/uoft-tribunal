   Grievances

   The Student was charged with seven offences under the Code of Behaviour
   on Academic Matters, in connection with evaluations in two different
   courses. The Student was charged with two counts knowingly representing
   as their own an idea or expression of an idea or work of another,
   contrary to section B.i.1(d), in connection with a pr√©cis assignment
   in HISB52 (the "First Course") and a critical analysis paper in POLB72
   (the "Second Course"). The Student was also charged with one count with
   knowingly using or possessing an unauthorized aid or obtaining and/or
   providing unauthorized assistance, contrary to section B.i.1(b), in
   connection with a take-home final exam in the Second Course, and in the
   alternative to the charge under section B.i.1(d) in connection with the
   Second Course. In the alternative to the foregoing charges, the Student
   was charged with three counts for knowingly engaging in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty, or misconduct, fraud or
   misrepresentation in order to obtain academic credit or academic
   advantage, contrary to section B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   The Student did not attend the hearing and was not represented by
   counsel. The University requested that the hearing proceed in the
   absence of the student and provided the Panel with a Book of Documents
   regarding the preliminary issue of notice and service on the Student.
   The Book of Documents contained several affidavits detailing the
   University's effort to contact the Student and deliver the Notice of
   Virtual Hearing, charges and disclosure to the Student by email,
   courier and by phone. The Panel was satisfied that, based on the
   extensive attempted correspondence with the Student, the Student had
   received reasonable notice of the charges and of the hearing date for
   the purposes of the Statutory Powers and Procedures Act and the
   University Tribunal's Rules of Practice and Procedure. The hearing
   proceeded in the absence of the Student.

   The University presented evidence in support of the charges related to
   the evaluations in the First and Second Courses. With respect to the
   First Course, the Student was required to submit a pr√©cis assignment
   that provided an overview of an academic text, worth 10% or the final
   mark in the First Course. The Panel considered affidavit evidence of
   the course instructor, which detailed textual similarities between the
   Student's pr√©cis and an online source that was not referenced or cited
   in the Student's work.

   With respect to the Second Course, the University presented additional
   evidence in relation to a Critical Analysis Paper (the ‚Paper‚) and
   Take Home Exam in the Second Course. The Student was required to submit
   the Paper which accounted for 35% of their final grade in the Second
   Course. Students were required to prepare the paper using a primary
   text, or secondary sources approved by the course instructor, upon
   consultation. The Student's Paper was flagged by the University's
   "Ouriginal" service, which detected verbatim and near verbatim
   similarities to several online sources. The Student was also required
   to complete a take home exam, worth 20% of their grade in the second
   course. The exam was open book, but students were required to provide
   in-text citations and a bibliography where secondary sources were
   directly quoted. The University's "Ouriginal" service detected verbatim
   and near verbatim similarities in the Student's submission to several
   online sources. Despite several attempts, the course instructor was not
   able to meet with the Student to discuss their concerns regarding the
   Student's Paper and take home exam submission.

   The Panel found that the evidence of plagiarism in connection with the
   Precis and the Paper, and unauthorized assistance in connection with
   the take home exam, was clear and convincing. Accordingly, the Panel
   found that the Student guilty of two counts of plagiarism, contrary to
   B.i.1(d), and one count of obtaining unauthorized assistance, contrary
   to section B.i.1(b) of the Code. The University withdrew the remainder
   of the charges.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered
   submissions from the University, cases decided by the Tribunal under
   similar circumstances, and the factors to be considered on penalty. The
   Panel noted that the Student committed the second and third offences
   after having received notice of the first and concluded that there was
   a higher likelihood that there would be a repetition of the offence.
   The Panel additionally noted that the Student did not engage in the
   process, and that there was no evidence of any mitigating factors that
   would factor into a reduction of the penalty. Finally, the Panel
   observed that the detriment to the University occasioned by the
   Student's offences were considerable, and the need for general
   deterrence - especially for repeat offenders - was high, warranted a
   higher penalty. The Panel accordingly concluded that a three-year
   suspension, as opposed to a merely two-year period, was in line with
   previous cases and addressed the serious nature of the offences at
   issue.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a final grade of zero in the
   First and Second Course; a three-year suspension; a four-year notation
   on the Student's academic record and transcript; and a report to the
   Provost for publication.

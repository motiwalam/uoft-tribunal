Trial Division – s. B.i.1(b) of the Code – unauthorized aid – Student brought completed Mid-Term Exam Booklet into final exam -- Student took materials seized by professor and fled – inability to determine whether materials were aids or not attributable to actions of the Student; Student must therefore provide credible, cogent evidence to support his contention – post-offence conduct more consistent with guilty mind than honest panic – finding of guilt – first offence – extraordinary post-offence conduct and deliberate deception is an aggravating factor – positive reference letters given little weight because authors were unaware of alleged misconduct –  evidence of personal tragedy does not mitigate when used to support factual innocence rather than contextualize guilty conduct – grade assignment of zero in the course; three-year suspension; four-year notation on transcript; report to Provost for publication -- Decision issuance delayed for reasons beyond Student’s control; suspension and transcript notation deemed to begin on final day of hearing rather than date of issuance

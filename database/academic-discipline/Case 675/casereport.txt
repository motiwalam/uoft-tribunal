Charges and Procedural History
The Trial Division of the Tribunal held a hearing on March 4, 2014 to address the following
charges brought by the University of Toronto (the "University") against~ ~
(the "Student") under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (the "Code"):
1) On or about January 18, 2012, you knowingly represented as your own an idea
or expression of an idea, and/or work of another in connection with a form of
academic work, namely an assignment submitted to fulfill the course
requirements of PHL333H5S, contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code.
2) In the alternative, on or about January 18, 2012, you knowingly engaged in a
form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in an
assignment submitted to fulfill course requirements in PHL333H5S, contrary to
section B.l.3(b) of the Code.

2.

Th is matter first came to hearing on January 10, 2013 before a different panel chaired by
Mr. Jeffrey Leon. At that time, the Student attended unrepresented and made a request
for an adjournment in order to retain counsel.

3.

The request for an adjournment was granted by the panel, and the Student subsequently
retained counsel, Ms. Schumacher, who represented her at the hearing on March 4, 2014.

4.

In December 2013, a second Notice of Hearing was issued which identified a new panel
for the hearing of this matter. On the basis of a joint request by the University and the
Student, Mr. Leon ordered that the matter could proceed before a new panel as the
orig inal panel had not heard any evidence.

II.

Agreed Statement of Facts

5.

At the outset of the hearing, the Panel was advised that the Student was pleading guilty to
the charges and that the matter would proceed on the basis of an Agreed Statement of
Facts (attached as Appendix A to this decision). The Panel was also advised that if the
Student's plea was accepted, that the University would withdraw the second, alternative
charge.

2

6.

The Panel received into evidence a Joint Book of Documents that is referred to in the
Agreed Statement of Facts.

7.

As is set out in more detail in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the charges arose out of an
assignment that the Student submitted on January 18, 2012 in PHL333H5S: Issues in
Epistemology (the "Course"), which was taught by Professor Jonathan Weisberg.

8.

The assignment was submitted in both hardcopy and through Turnitin.com, a website that
detects potential plagiarism by comparing assignments against a database. Turnitin
identified significant similarities between the Student's assignment and a particular student
paper submitted to the University of Cape Town. A Google search also revealed that a
section of the text of the Assignment was taken from another online source, without
attribution.

9.

The Panel was provided with an annotated version of the assignment identifying the
portions that were taken from these sources.

From this annotated version it is evident

that more than 50% of the assignment was taken verbatim or near verbatim from these
sources. The analysis also showed that the Student had changed certain words within
phrases taken from these sources, from which the Panel inferred that the Student had
taken intentional steps to avoid detection of her copying from these sources.
10.

Professor Weisberg met with the Student on March 27, 2012 to discuss the similarities
between the Assignment and the above-mentioned source materials. He subsequently
referred the case to the Office of the Dean.

11.

On April 17, 2012, the Student attended a Dean's Designate meeting with Professor
Sidney Aster to discuss the allegations that she had violated the Code. At the Dean's
meeting, the Student indicated that she had not intentionally plagiarized and that she had
been distracted because of family celebrations taking place during that time. When asked
whether she would like to plead guilty or not guilty, the Student was uncertain how to
plead and therefore abstained from pleading. Professor Aster then forwarded the matter to
the Provost for resolution.

Ill.
12.

Finding on Charges

Following deliberation and based on the facts in the Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint
Book of Documents, the Panel concluded that charge 1 had been proven and accepted
3

the guilty plea of the Student in respect of that charge.

Given that finding of guilt the

University withdrew charge 2.

IV.

13.

Penalty

The Panel was provided with a further Agreed Statement of Facts for Sanction, which is
attached as Appendix B.

14.

The Student had committed two previous offences. The first took place in Winter 2007 in
GGR117Y5Y: Where on Earth (the "Geography Course") and the second took place in
Winter 2008 in PHL277Y5Y: Moral Social & Political Philosophy (the "Philosophy
Course").

15.

On April 4, 2007, the Student submitted an assignment worth 6% of her final grade in the
Geography Course. When the assignments were corrected, the Teaching Assistant for
the course noticed similarities between the Student's assignment and that of another
student. When the Student met with the instructor of the Geography Course about this
assignment, the Student admitted to having been involved in plagiarism and explained
that she had been pressed for time. The Student was given a penalty of a 50% mark
reduction for her assignment and warned that any future offences would automatically be
forwarded to the VP-Academic's Office.

16.

On February 27, 2008, the Student submitted an assignment worth 25% of her final grade
in the Philosophy Course on Turnitin. A Turnitin Originality Report revealed an Overall
Similarity Index of 47% with a 40% match to a paper found on the internet that was
submitted at Texas A&M University. When the Student met with the Dean's Designate
about this assignment she admitted that she was guilty of plagiarizing the assignment and
cited carelessness and family and personal issues to explain her conduct. The Student
was given a mark of zero in the Philosophy Course and an annotation on her transcript of
"Mark of zero [ ... ] due to academic misconduct" for one year. She was further warned that
any subsequent allegations of academic offences would be referred directly to the
Tribunal for investigation, which is how she came to be before the Panel on this latest
academic offence.

17.

The Panel was also advised that the Student had entered into an Undertaking to complete
eight Academic Skills Workshops totalling a minimum of 7.5 hours of instruction through

4

the University's College Writing Centres Academic Skills Workshops (attached as
Appendix C).

As part of the Undertaking, the Student agreed that she would not be

eligible to graduate from the University until she fulfills the Undertaking.
18.

This Undertaking formed the basis for the Joint Submission on Penalty, which
contemplated inter alia a three year suspension.

The cases indicate that a two year

suspension is a threshold penalty for plagiarism (The University of Toronto and Mr. A,
dated May 13, 2011, para. 29 [Case No. 591 ]), and given that this was the Student's third
plagiarism offence, three years is on the light end of the spectrum.
19.

The use of these kinds of undertakings is relatively recent. Discipline Counsel took the
Panel to the first case in which such an undertaking was considered by the Tribunal in The
University of Toronto and Ms. H ("Ms. H. '?, dated February 16, 2010 [Case No. 490], and

to several subsequent cases in which a similar approach has been taken.
20.

In that decision, the Tribunal noted (at para. 9) that "the panel was satisfied that the
University and the Student had approached the concept of the undertaking in a
conscientious way - by selecting a course of study that would achieve the rehabilitative
end required." The Tribunal in Ms. H also noted (at para. 11) that "previous penalties
imposed [for previous plagiarism offences of Ms. H] did little to help change behaviour."
Taken together these statements echo the views of the Panel that these kinds of
undertakings are to be commended, but would likely have a greater impact if they were
used at the discovery of a first offence, rather than waiting until a Student is facing
suspension or expulsion. The Tribunal clearly has no jurisdiction until a student is before
it, but the Panel would urge the University to consider using such undertakings at a
student's first brush with academic discipline.

21.

For similar reasons, the Panel would also recommend that future undertakings
contemplate a student completing Academic Skills Workshops or other relevant courses
before enrolling in further coursework at the University, if such a staged approach is
feasible.

22.

The Student asked to say a few words to the Panel and was granted the opportunity to do
so. She expressed remorse and appeared visibly distressed by the proceedings.

23.

Counsel for the Student provided submissions on the factors to be taken into
consideration in coming to penalty (the factors enunciated in The University of Toronto
5

and Mr. C, dated November 5, 1976 at p. 12 [Case No. 1976/77-3]), including submissions

on the character of the Student and extenuating circumstances.

However, the Panel

could not take the majority of these submissions into consideration because the facts on
which they were based were not in evidence. 1
24.

In the result, little turns on these submissions given the high threshold for rejecting a joint
submission. The Panel found that this threshold had not been met in this case. Taking
the prior offences and the Undertaking into consideration, the penalty proposed by both
parties is in line with penalties ordered in similar circumstances. Certainly, the Panel was
of the view that accepting the joint submission on penalty would not bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

25.

V.

26.

The Panel therefore accepted the joint submission on penalty.

Decision of the Panel

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel conferred and made the following order:
a. the Student is guilty of one count of plagiarism, contrary to section B.I.1 (d) of the
Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters;
b. the Student shall receive a final grade of zero in PHL333H5S in the 2012 Winter
Term;
c. the Student be suspended from the University for a period of three years,
commencing on March 4, 2014 and ending on March 3, 2017;
d. the sanction be recorded on the Student's academic record and transcript to the
effect that she was sanctioned for academic misconduct, for a period of four
years from the date of this Order, to March 3, 2018, or until her graduation from
the University, whichever is earlier; and
e. this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed, with the name of
the student withheld.

1 The only facts in evidence were the two Agreed Statements of Facts and the Joint Book of Documents.

Although

the Student addressed the Tribunal, she was not sworn, and no witnesses were called.

On January 18, 2012, Ms. ~ submitted Assignment #1 (the "Assignment")

in both hardcopy and through Turnitin.com. A copy of the Assignment is included in
Exhibit 1 at Tab 6.
10.

Turnitin identified a 29% similarity index with a number of student papers

submitted to other universities. A copy of the Turnitin Originality Report is included in
Exhibit 1 at Tab 7.
11.

Turnitin identified a 23% similarity index with a particular student paper submitted

to the University of Cape Town. A copy of this paper, titled "Lecture 10: Goldman's
Causal Theory of Knowledge", is included in Exhibit 1 at Tab 8. This paper can be
retrieved

annotated copies of the two unattributed source materials described in paragraphs 11
and 12 of this ASF are included in Exhibit 1 at Tab 9. The highlighting and annotations
on these documents indicate which sections of the Assignment have been plagiarized.

14.

Professor Weisberg met with Ms. ~ on March 27, 2012 to discuss the

similarities between the Assignment and the above-mentioned source materials. He
subsequently referred the case to the Office of the Dean.
15.

On April 17, 2012, Ms. ~ attended a Dean's Designate meeting with

Professor Sidney Aster to discuss the allegations that she had violated the Code. At the
Dean's meeting, Ms. ~ indicated that she had not intentionally plagiarized and
that she had been distracted because of family celebrations taking place during that
time. When asked whether she would like to plead guilty or not guilty, Ms. ~ was
uncertain how to plead and therefore abstained from pleading. Professor Aster
forwarded the matter to the Provost for resolution.
16.

Ms. ~ admits that in submitting the Assignment in PHL333H5S in Winter

2012 she knowingly submitted academic work in which she represented as her own an
idea or expression of an idea, or work of another contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the
Code.
17.

Ms. ~ acknowledges that she is signing this ASF freely and voluntarily,

and knowing the potential consequences she faces. Ms. ~ acknowledges that
before she signed this ASF, the Provost provided her with the opportunity to obtain legal
advice. Ms. ~ agrees that she has either obtained legal advice or has deliberately

Ms. ~ admitted to having been involved in plagiarism in this case. Ms.

2

when she finished an answer, she shared it with L. T. and that L. T. did the same
for her.

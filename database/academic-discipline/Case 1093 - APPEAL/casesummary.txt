   The Trial Division of the University Tribunal found the Student guilty
   of the offence of obtaining unauthorized assistance contrary to section
   B.i.1(b) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters , 2019. On appeal
   before the Discipline Appeals Board (âBoardâ), the Student sought to
   admit fresh evidence regarding their personal circumstances at the time
   of the offence and requested a reduction in the length of a four-year
   suspension in light of such evidence.

   The Board outlined that there were two issues on appeal. The first
   issue was whether the Board should exercise its discretion to admit the
   Studentâs fresh statements in the Studentâs Appeal Submission and
   Factum for the purposes of the appeal on penalty. The second issue was
   whether the Board should exercise its discretion to set aside the Joint
   Submission of Penalty ("JSP") presented to the Tribunal and
   subsequently accepted by it.

   On the first issue, the Board noted that it had authority in
   exceptional circumstances to allow the introduction of further evidence
   on appeal, at its discretion, where such evidence was unavailable at
   the time of or was not adduced at the original hearing. The Board
   declined to exercise its discretion to admit the fresh evidence in the
   Studentâs Appeal Submission and Factum for several reasons. First, the
   Board found that the evidence was unsworn, vague, and unsubstantiated.
   Second, the evidence as it related to the Studentâs personal
   circumstances was available at the time of the original hearing, and
   could not be tested on cross-examination by the University on appeal as
   it would have been at the original hearing. Finally, the Board noted
   that the Student had joined in the Agreed Statement of Facts detailing
   the Studentâs personal circumstances, which was canvassed by the
   Tribunal.

   With respect to the second issue, namely, whether the JSP should be set
   aside and the sanction varied, the Board noted that while it possessed
   the jurisdiction to vary sanction, it declined to do so in this case.Â
   The Board found that the Student had failed to demonstrate any reason
   to permit them to resile from the JSP, and further noted that the Board
   ought to afford significant deference to the Tribunal to approve the
   JSPâs provided by the University and the Student, provided that the JSP
   is voluntarily entered into with a full appreciation of its
   consequences. The Board concluded that there was no basis to set aside
   the JSP.

   The Studentâs appeal was dismissed.

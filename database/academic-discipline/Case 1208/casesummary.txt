   On two occasions the Student was charged under s. B.i.1(d) Code of
   Behaviour on Academic Matters , 1995 (the â Codeâ) on the basis that
   they knowingly represented as their own an idea or expression of an
   idea or work of another in an essay and a revised essay. The Student
   was also charged with two counts of knowingly submitting academic work
   containing a purported statement of fact or reference to a source which
   had been concocted, contrary to s. B.i.1(f) of the Code. The Student
   was further charged with two counts of knowingly engaging in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
   not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit
   or other academic advantage, contrary to s. B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   A hearing convened on June 15, 2022 to consider the aforementioned
   charges of academic dishonesty brought by the University against the
   Student. The June 15, 2022 hearing was adjourned during the penalty
   phase. A continuation hearing took place on July 22, 2022 where the
   Student was represented by Downtown Legal Services.

   The hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Fact
   (âASFâ). The ASF outlined that the Student submitted an essay in the
   course through Turnitin.com which detected that the essay had a
   similarity index of 43% to numerous source documents. The teaching
   assistant (T.A.) wrote to the Student regarding the similarity index
   report and the Student responded advising the T.A. that they had
   accidently submitted their draft which didnât contain citations, and
   included a link to a revised essay. Upon review of the essay, the
   Professor who taught the course for which the essay in question was
   submitted confirmed that there were passages in the assignment that
   were taken verbatim or nearly verbatim from external sources without
   attribution. Furthermore, the essay contained references cited in the
   footnotes that did not contain the words or ideas to which they were
   cited in the body of the essay. The ASF also outlined that the revised
   essay showed considerable similarity with the original essay, but
   certain passages had been edited and revised but incorrect citations
   that were identified in the original essay remained in the revised
   essay. The Professor forwarded the file to the Office of Student
   Academic Integrity but the Student did not respond to requests to meet
   with the Deanâs Designate. The ASF contained various admissions and
   acknowledgements on the part of the Student. The Student admitted that
   they knowingly committed plagiarism, knowingly submitted academic work
   contained a purported statement of fact or reference to a source which
   has been concocted, and knew or ought to have known that they engaged
   in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud of
   misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code. After
   considering the evidence and the ASF, the Panel concluded that charges
   1 and 2 were proven on a balance of probabilities; the Student
   knowingly committed plagiarism and knowingly submitted academic work
   containing a purported statement of fact or a reference to a source
   which has been concocted. The University withdrew the remaining
   charges.

   The Panel received a JSP. In considering the JSP, the Panel noted that
   the admission of wrongdoing came early on, and it noted that Student's
   desire to have the issue resolved as soon as possible.Â The Panel also
   took into consideration the serious and deliberate nature of the
   offence and the detriment to the University. Having regard for the
   circumstances of this matter, and based on the review of similar cases,
   the Panel found that the joint submission was reasonable. The Panel
   imposed the following sanctions: a grade of zero in the course; a
   three-year suspension; a four-year notation on the Studentâs
   transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

1.

This Panel of the University Tribunal held a hearing on March 12, 2020 to consider the

(iv)

PAP124 Test 2

(v)

PAP127 Test 3

(vi)

PAP125 Final Exam

(vii)

3.

In brief, the allegations are as follows: At the material times, the Student was enrolled in
the Physician Assistant program. In the 2019 Winter term, she was enrolled in several
courses in which tests were conducted online. No aids were allowed to be used during the
tests and students were not permitted to access any online or outside assistance. The
charges above allege that the Student knowingly possessed and /or used information
accessed on the Internet during the tests as an unauthorized aid.

4.

The Student appeared at the hearing and was represented by Downtown Legal Services.
The hearing proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts (the “ASF”), which
was marked as Exhibit 1. The parties also presented a Joint Book of Documents (the
“JBD”) that is referred to in the ASF, which was marked as Exhibit 2. The Panel
reviewed the documents in the JBD during the course of the hearing to be satisfied that
they supported the facts agreed to in the ASF. The facts admitted in the ASF relate to
Charges 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. A summary of the agreed facts follows.

Evidence and Findings
5.

The Student first registered at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Arts and Science in
Fall 2011, and graduated with distinction with an Honours Bachelor of Science in June
2015.

6.

In the 2018 Fall Term, the Student enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine Bachelor of
Science Physician Assistant program (“PA Program”). As of March 2, 2020, she had
earned 3.50 credits in the PA Program with a CGPA of 3.8.

7.

In the 2019 Winter term, the Student was enrolled in five courses in the PA Program, four
of which are the subject of the academic misconduct allegations.

8.

Students in the PA Program courses were required to write a number of tests and exams,
administered on line, to complete the courses. Each test at issue was worth between 25%

-4-

and 35% of the course mark. The tests were conducted online using Canvas software on
the Quercus learning management system (“Quercus System”).
9.

The tests and exams contained a statement warning that the exam was proctored and
electronically monitored, and that the use of any written or electronic material was not
permitted. Reference to academic conduct and offences with a link to the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters was also included on the tests.

10.

One of the features of the Quercus System is that it logs a student’s activity while they
are engaged in writing a test or exam online. The Student’s actions – starting the session,
viewing and flagging questions, answering questions, stopping viewing the test-taking
page, etc. – are all logged with time stamps (“Action Logs”). In addition, for tests written
using the Google Chrome browser, a browser history shows all of the student’s online
activity during the taking of the test or exam. These browser histories show, for example,
any Google Internet searches performed while the Student was taking the test.

11.

The Student took her PA Program tests and exams on the Quercus System in the Medical
Science Computer Lab.

12.

During the PAP124 Test 2 on April 15, 2019 (Charge 4), an exam invigilator became
suspicious that the Student was accessing online resources. At the conclusion of the test,
a Chrome browser history was downloaded for preservation. Chrome browser histories
were also preserved for the Student’s PAP125 Final Exam on April 17, 2019 (Charge 6)
and her PAP122 Test on April 18, 2019 (Charge 7). No browser histories were preserved
from earlier tests and for a test where the Student used a Firefox browser (Charges 1, 3
and 5).

13.

The Action Log for each test, the Student’s tests results and the Chrome browser
histories, where available, were included in the JBD.

14.

In relation to Charge 1, the Student admitted that on February 25, 2019, while writing
PAP124 Test 1, she knowingly accessed the Internet to search for relevant information to
assist her in answering questions on the test. This admission is consistent with entries on
the Action Log for that test which show that the Student was inactive or stopped viewing
the test and accessed another browser or window on the computer repeatedly during the
test period.

15.

The Student similarly admitted to knowingly accessing the Internet to search for relevant
information to assist her to answer questions while writing PAP122 Test 2 on March 18,
2019 (Charge 3), and while writing PAP127 Test 3 on April 16, 2019 (Charge 5). Again,
these admissions are consistent with the entries on the Action Log for the respective tests.

16.

In relation to Charge 4, the Student admitted that while she was writing the PAP 124 Test
2, on April 15, 2019, she knowingly accessed the Internet multiple times to search for
relevant information to assist her to answer questions on the test. That admission is
consistent both with the entries on the Action Log, and also with the browser history from
the test period. This browser history shows that the Student, during the taking of the test,
performed Google searches for terms and phrases taken directly from the test questions.

-5-

For example, at approximately the time as the Student was viewing questions relating to
essential hypertension, the browser history shows that the Student conducted a Google
search for “essential hypertension.”
17.

Similarly, in relation to Charges 6 and 7, the Student admitted to conducting multiple
Internet searches to assist her in answering questions on the PAP125 Final Exam (Charge
6), taken on April 17, 2019, and on PAP122 Test 3 (Charge 7), taken on April 18, 2019.
These admissions are consistent both with entries on the respective Action Logs, and also
with the browser histories for each test period.

18.

On May 8, 2019 the Board of Examiners for the PA Program met to consider the issues
raised by the allegations described above. The Student provided a written statement to
the Board during their considerations, in which she accepted responsibility for her
actions. The Board referred the matter in keeping with the Code of Behaviour on
Academic Matters.

19.

On May 23, 2019, the Student met with Dr. Lynn Wilson, Vice-Dean, Partnerships,
Faculty of Medicine. During this meeting, the Student took responsibility for her actions
of academic misconduct and stated that she regretted her actions. The Student explained
that she was studying all the time and worked very hard in the program but continued to
receive marks around the class average. She said that she became anxious during the
exams and apologized for her actions.

20.

Due to the nature of the program, which requires continual and consistent progression
through the program in sequence, the Student was suspended from the PA program
pending completion of the Tribunal process.

21.

Following deliberations and based on the ASF and the JBD, the Panel concluded that
Charges 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 had been proven with clear and convincing evidence on a
balance of probabilities, and accepted the guilty plea of the Student in respect of those
charges. The Panel was advised that if the Tribunal convicted the Student on those
charges, the University would withdraw Charges 2 and 8 (the alternative charge) and
those charges were so withdrawn.

Penalty
22.

The Student and University submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty (“JSP”) in support
of the following penalty:
(a)

A final grade of zero in the following courses in the 2019 Winter term:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

(b)

PAP122H1;
PAP124H1
PAP125H1; and
PAP127H1.

That the Student be suspended from the University of Toronto from May 23, 2019
to August 31, 2022; and

-6-

(c)

A notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript from the day the
Tribunal makes its order to August 31, 2024 or her graduation from the Physician
Assistant Program, whichever occurs first.

23.

The parties also submitted that this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of
a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction imposed, with the name of the
Student withheld.

24.

As the Tribunal has stated in many cases, absent exceptional circumstances, panels are
expected to accept and implement joint statements on penalty. As set out in the Discipline
Appeals Board decision in The University of Toronto and M. A. (Case No. 837,
December 22, 2016), a joint submission on penalty “may be rejected by a panel only in
circumstances where to give effect to it would be contrary to the public interest or would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute” (para 25).

25.

In the Panel’s view, the joint submission in this case is reasonable and appropriate. In
arriving at this decision, the Panel took into consideration the nature of the offences, the
detriment to the University occasioned by the offences, the need to deter other students
from acting in a similar manner, the character of the Student, and the circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offence.

26.

These are very serious offences. Cheating on an exam is profoundly unfair to other
students. As this Tribunal has previously noted, “the integrity of examinations is a
cornerstone of academic life” Y.Y. (, Case No. 851, March 1, 2017). The misconduct at
issue took place repeatedly over several months. It was not a one-time lapse in judgment.

27.

However, there were also mitigating factors to consider. The Student has no prior history
of academic misconduct at the University. She admitted guilt an early opportunity and
has cooperated throughout the process, including entering into the ASF and JSP. These
actions demonstrate insight and remorse, as did the Student’s testimony before the
Tribunal. The Student spoke eloquently about the mistakes she had made, the stresses she
was under at the time she engaged in the misconduct at issue, the steps she is taking to
ensure there is no repetition of the conduct, and her gratitude for being given an
opportunity to return to her studies in the future.

28.

In general, sanctions should commence from the date the sanction is imposed by the
Tribunal. In exceptional circumstances, however, the commencement of a sanction can
date back earlier. Here, the parties jointly submit that the Student’s suspension should
begin on May 23, 2019. The Panel notes that the Student admitted guilt at an early stage
and has not contributed to any delay in resolving the Charges. Moreover, due to the
nature of the Physician Assistant program, which requires continual and consistent
progression through the program in sequence, the Student will need to go back and repeat
her first semester. The Panel agrees that, in the circumstances of this case, it is
appropriate to backdate the commencement of the sanction.

-7-

29.

Accordingly, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel issued the following Order,
which is hereby confirmed:
(a)

THAT the Student is found guilty of six counts of knowingly using or possessing
an unauthorized aid(s) or obtaining unauthorized assistance contrary to section
B.I.1(b) of the Code.

(b)

THAT the Student shall receive a final grade of zero in the following courses in
the 2019 Winter term:
(i)

PAP122H1;

(ii)

PAP124H1;

(iii)

PAP125H1; and

(iv)

PAP127H1.

(c)

THAT the Student be suspended from the University of Toronto from May 23,
2019 to August 31, 2022.

(d)

THAT a notation shall be placed on the Student’s academic record and transcript
from the day the Tribunal makes its order to August 31, 2024 or her graduation
from the Physician Assistant Program, whichever occurs first; and

(e)

THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed, with the name of
the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto this 6th day of May, 2020.

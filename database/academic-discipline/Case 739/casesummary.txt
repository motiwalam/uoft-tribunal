   Grievances
   Trial Division â s. B.i.1(a) and s. B.i.3(b) of the Code â forgery â
   impersonation of a graduate at graduation ceremony â Student not at
   hearing â Admission of Guilt at Deanâs Designate meeting â finding of
   guilt â third offence â recommendation of expulsion; five year
   suspension; academic record notation; report to Provost
   The Student impersonated another student at a graduation ceremony. He
   mounted the stage, had his photo taken using the name of a real
   graduate, and signed a book in order to receive a diploma. The Student
   had two prior offences of plagiarism for which he received a zero in
   the course. Â In a meeting with the Deanâs Designate the Student
   admitted his guilt under s. B.i.1(a) and s. B.i.3(b) of the Code .
   The Student did not appear at the hearing and the Panel felt that,
   coupled with the prior offences, the Student had no place at the
   University. The Panel said the Studentâs actions were deliberate,
   brazen, and without explanation. The Panel recommended expulsion,
   imposed a suspension of up to five years or until expulsion, whichever
   comes first, a notation be placed on his academic record, and that the
   case be reported to the Provost for publication.

   The Student was charged with one count under s. B.i.1(a) of the Code of
   knowingly forging or in any other way altering or falsifying a document
   or evidence required by the University of Toronto in connection with an
   application which the Student submitted for a Senior Doctoral
   Fellowship. In the alternative the Student was charged with knowingly
   engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct,
   fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in order to obtain
   academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind, contrary to s.
   B.i.3(b).

   The hearing proceeded on the basis of Agreed Statement of Facts
   (‚ASF‚). The Student was in their fifth year of a doctoral program and
   applied for a Senior Doctoral Fellowship in the Caribbean Studies
   Program. As part of the application the Student was required to submit
   a curriculum vita, a summary of their doctoral thesis and progress to
   date, and a letter of recommendation from their dissertation supervisor
   (the ‚Application‚). As part of the Application, the Student
   represented that their PhD dissertation was well underway, that their
   comprehensive exams included a significant focus on Caribbean history
   and literature, and that included an article (the ‚Article‚) under
   review by a peer-reviewed academic journal (the ‚Journal‚). The Student
   also included mention of the Article in their curriculum vitae. At a
   meeting with an Associate Professor of History at the University, the
   Student was asked to produce the Article. At that point, the Student
   admitted that there was in fact no actual article. The Student further
   acknowledged that they had overstated their involvement in Caribbean
   literature and critical theory in their Application and apologized to
   the Professor. The matter was referred to the Dean‚s Designate for
   Academic Integrity. The Student subsequently admitted at the Meeting
   that they had never submitted the Article to the Journal, and more
   generally, that the Student had knowingly misrepresented the
   information contained in the Application. The Student offered to return
   the $1,500 stipend that they had received for the Senior Doctoral
   Fellowship. The Student repeated these admissions in the ASF. On the
   basis of the ASF, the Panel concluded that the first charge was proven
   on the balance of probabilities and accepted the Student‚s guilty plea.
   The University withdrew the alternative charge.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered a Joint
   Submission on Penalty submitted by the Student and the University. The
   Panel heard submissions regarding the appropriateness of the penalty
   and relevant past decisions of the Tribunal and considered the factors
   set out in the University of Toronto and Mr. C. (Case No. 1976/77-3,
   November 5, 1976). With respect to the Student character, the Panel
   noted the Student‚s cooperation with the process and expression of
   remorse. With respect to general deterrence and the detriment to the
   University, the University stated that the need to deter was important
   in this case, as the Student‚s actions could have denied other
   candidates from the Fellowship opportunity and, more generally,
   compromised the integrity of the University and its programs. The
   parties also requested that the start date of the suspension be
   deferred almost a month to allow the Student to work with his
   dissertation committee as the Student‚s thesis was nearing completion.
   Having regard to the foregoing, the Panel noted that the joint
   submission was reasonable.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a three-year suspension from
   the University to begin May 1, 2024; a notation on the Student‚s
   academic record and transcript until graduation; and a report to the
   Provost for publication.

BACKGROUND
[1]
The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on March 30, 2005 to
consider charges brought under the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 against Ms.
L. by letter dated July 16, 2004 from the Vice-President and Provost, Professor Vivek Goel.
[2]

The letter of July 16, 2004 contained the following charges:
1.

On or about December 17, 2003, you did knowingly use or possess an
unauthorized aid or aids or obtained unauthorized assistance in any academic
examination or term test, namely the final examination in MAT188H1 Linear
Algebra, contrary to Section B.I.1.(b) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters (“the Code”). Pursuant to section B of the Code, you are deemed to have
committed the offence knowingly if you ought reasonably to have known that you
used or possessed an unauthorized aid or aids or obtained unauthorized assistance
in any academic examination or term test contrary to Section B.I.1.(b).

2.

In the alternative, on or about December 17, 2003, you did knowingly engage in a
form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in the
final examination in MAT188, contrary to Section B.I.3(b) of the Code. Pursuant
to Section B of the Code, you are deemed to have committed the offence
knowingly if you ought reasonably to have known that you used or possessed an
unauthorized aid or aids or obtained unauthorized assistance in any academic
examination.

33637 v.2

-2[3]
The University and Ms. L. submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts in which Ms. L.
acknowledged that she was guilty of knowingly possessing an unauthorized aid during the
writing of the final examination in the course MAT188 in the form of notes of formulae relevant
to the subject matter of the exam. This was contrary to Section B.I.1(b) of the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters as set out in Charge 1. Ms. L. confirmed orally that she
understood the charge, that it was her signature on the Agreed Statement of Facts and that she
pleaded guilty to Charge 1.
[4]

The University indicated that it would not be proceeding with Charge 2.

[5]
The panel considered the physical and written evidence, the Agreed Statement of Facts,
Ms. L.’s acknowledgement that the Statement of Facts was true, and the relevant sections of the
Code.
[6]
1.

Following deliberations, the panel accepted Ms. L.’s plea and found her guilty of Charge
SANCTION

[7]
The panel heard a Joint Submission With Respect to Sanction. The Chair determined to
his satisfaction that Ms. L. had knowingly agreed to the sanctions and was aware of the
consequences of her agreement. Following deliberation, the panel accepted the following Joint
Submission With Respect to Sanction:
1.

A grade of zero in the course of MAT188 (Linear Algebra) for the 2003 Fall
academic session;

2.

Suspension from the University for a period of two (2) years from April 1, 2005
to March 31, 2007;

3.

This sanction shall be recorded on the student’s academic record and transcript for
two (2) years from April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2007; and

4.

The case should be reported to the Provost to publish a notice of the decision of
the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University newspapers,
with the name of the student withheld.
REASONS FOR SANCTION
(delivered orally)

[8]
The panel considered the Joint Submission With Respect to Sanction and reviewed the
book of tribunal decisions submitted by the University. Certainly the grade of zero in the course
was appropriate, particularly in light of the earlier incident. The panel was prepared to accept the
Joint Submission With Respect to Sanctions on the following basis. The most important feature
was that this was a second offence of a similar if not exact nature to one in the first term and that
it had occurred in the student’s second academic term. Thus, the behaviour was repeated
immediately in the next academic term, notwithstanding the strong warning from the Dean of
Applied Science and Engineering in a letter of January 2003. The panel further considered that

-3the student had agreed to the sanctions. Finally, the panel noted that this was a serious offence
committed in essentially a system which is an honour system. Whether the offence had been
discovered or not was a matter of chance so there must be seen to be a deterrent to others who
may engage in similar conduct.

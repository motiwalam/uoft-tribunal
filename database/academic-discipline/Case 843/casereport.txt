Her death has not yet been registered, therefore I am unable to provide a
Death Certificate. However, my college Registrar informed me that it was

11

1.

Ms. L

9.

9.

Ms. ~

•s employment at the CNE totalled 157 hours of work overall.

There was a joint submission on penalty, in which both parties requested that this
panel make an order as follows:
(a)

a final grade of zero in each of:
(i)

NEW280Y1Y in the 2014 Fall and 2015 Winter term, and

(ii)

ITA100Y1Y in the 2015 Summer term;

12

(b)

a four year suspension from the University to commence June 20, 2016,
and to end June 19, 2020; and

(c)

a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript to
remain for five years until June 19, 2021.

10.

The parties also submitted that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to report
this case to the Provost for publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal
and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University newspapers, with the
name of the student withheld.

11 .

The Tribunal considered the principles and factors relevant to sanction set out by
this Tribunal in University of Toronto and Mr. C (Case No. 1976/77-3, November
5, 1976). While the determination of an appropriate penalty in every case by the

Tribunal will depend on an individual assessment of these principles and factors,
it is important to have general consistency in the Tribunal's approach to sanction
so that students are treated fairly and equitably.
12.

The Tribunal considered the factors and principles and factors relevant to
sanction set out by this Tribunal in University of Toronto and Mr. C (Case No.
1976/77-3, November 5, 1976).
(a)

The character of the Student: the Student attended at the hearing and
made admissions of misconduct.

She made these admissions to the

Dean's Designate and to this Tribunal. The Tribunal recognizes these
admissions are a sign the Student now takes responsibility for her
misconduct. The Tribunal also recognizes that the Student had various
part-time jobs at the time she engaged in this misconduct.
(b)

The likelihood of a repetition of the offence: the Tribunal was concerned
that the six admitted Charges involved not just one but two separate
incidents of deliberate deception.
ensure specific deterrence.

A significant penalty is required to

13

(c)

The nature of the offence committed: this was a deliberate, careful,
detailed, and repeated fabrication of documents, undertaken for the sole
purpose of misleading the University and gaining academic advantage.
The Student was initially successful in deceiving the University. It was
only when she dared to repeat the offence that she was caught.

(d)

Any extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence: the Student's representative submitted that the Student's parttime work provided context for the academic misconduct. He submitted
that the Student had significant additional responsibilities through her
employment, which added to her commuting burdens. The Tribunal did
not rely heavily on this evidence, and did not find it particularly helpful in
explaining how and why the Student resorted to her calculated scheme of
deception.

The Tribunal did consider that this was the Student's first

academic offence.

The Tribunal accepts that by admitting her

misconduct, the Student has shown remorse and responsibility.
(e)

The detriment to the University occasioned by the misconduct: the
Student's actions threaten to undermine a laudable and important system
of accommodation put in place by the University.

By fabricating the

deaths of her grandparents, the Student took advantage of the
University's accommodation processes in a callous and cynical manner.
(f)

The need to deter others from committing similar offences: deliberate
falsification must always be denounced and deterred.

13.

In addition to considering the factors from Mr. C., supra, the Tribunal considered
other cases of this Tribunal in similar circumstances: University of Toronto and hj

1 - ,ti (Case No. 775, December 1, 2014); University of Toronto and
~ c■ (Case No. 733, September 11, 2014); University of Toronto and

~ . (Case No. 702, April 15, 2013); S-

!=-illl and University

of Toronto (Case No. 690 - Appeal, October 20, 2014); University of Toronto and
S.M. (Case No. 696, September 12, 2013); University of Toronto and ~

14

A- - ~ (Case No. 674, January 25. 2013); and University of
Toronto and P.P. (Case No. 642, June 10, 2011 ). These cases show the range

of sanctions that have been imposed in cases where students have forged
documents in order to obtain academic accommodations. While certain aspects
of the sanction are consistent across all cases (a final grade of zero for the
affected course or courses), there is some variation in the length of suspension
ordered, depending on the particular circumstances of the student and the
particular balance of aggravating and mitigating factors.

The high end of the

range for a suspension is 5 years, and the low end is 2 years.

The joint

submission proposed by the parties in the present case is fairly within that range.
14.

The Tribunal also considered that it ought to defer to joint submissions. While
the Tribunal retains the discretion to reject joint submissions in appropriate
cases, the fact that adversarial parties have been able to agree on the
appropriate sanction is a good indication in and of itself that the appropriate
balance of interests has occurred.

The Tribunal found the proposed sanction

was in the range of sanctions imposed in other cases, and was fair and
reasonable in light of the factors and principles relating to sanctions generally.
15.

In all of the circumstances, and with regard to the factors identified in the C.
case, the Tribunal is satisfied that the following Order is appropriate:
1.

THAT Ms. L

is guilty of six counts of forgery contrary to

section 8.1.1 (a) of the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters;
2.

THAT Ms.

t . . - i receive a final grade of zero in each of:

(a) NEW280Y1Y in 2014 Fall and 2015 Winter term, and
(b) ITA100Y1Y in the 2015 Summer term;

15

3.

THAT Ms. ~ be suspended from the University for a period of

four years, commencing on June 20, 2016 and ending on June 19, 2020;

4.

THAT the sanction be recorded on Ms. L

s academic record

and transcript to the effect that she was sanctioned for academic
misconduct for a period of 5 years, commencing on June 20, 2016 and
ending on June 19, 2021; and
5.

THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice

of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed, with
the name of the student withheld.

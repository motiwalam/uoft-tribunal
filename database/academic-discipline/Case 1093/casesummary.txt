   The Student was charged with one count of knowingly representing as
   their own an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another
   in an assignment, contrary to section B.i.1(d) of the Code. They were
   also charged with one count of knowingly obtaining unauthorized
   assistance in connection with the assignment, contrary to section B.i.1
   (b)Â of the Code. In the alternative, they were charged with one count
   of knowingly engaging in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or
   misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the
   Code in connection with the assignment that they submitted in order to
   obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in a
   course, contrary to section B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   The Panel received the partiesâ Agreed Statement of Facts (âASFâ),
   containing agreed-upon facts regarding procedural issues, the Studentâs
   academic history, and details regarding a related matter. The Student
   submitted their assignment, and Turnitin flagged another studentâs
   assignment as 39% similar to the Studentâs assignment. When invited to
   do so, the Student did not attend a scheduled meeting with the
   professor to discuss the professorâs concerns. The Student eventually
   admitted that they had knowingly purchased unauthorized assistance for
   the entirety of their assignment from an individual who provided an
   essay writing service. They also admitted that in paying a third party
   to write their assignment, they had knowingly committed the offences
   set out in sections B.i.1(d), B.i.1(b)Â and B.i.3(b) of the Code. As a
   result, the Panel found that there were grounds to make a finding of
   guilt in relation to all three counts, but pursuant to the partiesâ
   joint submission, it only found the Student guilty of knowingly
   obtaining unauthorized assistance, contrary to section B.i.1(b) of the
   Code.

   In determining sanction, the Panel considered the partiesâ Executed
   Joint Submission on Penalty (âJSPâ) and the cases presented by the
   University. At the hearing, during their submissions on penalty, the
   Student outlined their personal circumstances and initially made a plea
   for further leniency from the Panel. They were reminded that although
   they were free to resile from the joint position on penalty, doing so
   would entitle the Provost to revisit their position on penalty, which
   could result in a request for and possible imposition of a higher
   penalty. The Student then clarified that they wished to maintain the
   joint position on penalty. The Panel found that the Studentâs request
   for a more lenient penalty was simply the expression of a student in a
   difficult situation and not a genuine attempt to resile from the joint
   submissions. The Panel noted that while the offence in question was
   serious, the Studentâs participation in the process, including entering
   into an ASF and JSP, was a mitigating factor. The fact that this was
   the Studentâs first offence was a further factor that mitigated
   penalty. Given the circumstances, the Panel found that the JSP was
   appropriate and adopted it.

   The Panel imposed the following sanctions: a grade of zero in the
   course; a four-year suspension; a five-year notation on the Student's
   transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication with the
   Studentâs name withheld .

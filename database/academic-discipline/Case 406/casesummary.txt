   Student charged under s. B.i.3(a), and alternatively, under s. B.i.3(b)
   of the Code. The charges related to allegations that the Student
   submitted an altered academic record to his employer, which
   misrepresented his marks in three courses and that he later altered his
   academic record in the same particulars when he submitted a second
   false record to the law firm. The matter proceeded on an Agreed
   Statement of Facts and a contested hearing on sanction. The Student
   admitted that he had asked a friend to effect the two alterations to
   his academic record because he believed it would improve his chances of
   being offered an articling position and subsequently a job as an
   associate lawyer at the law firm. The Panel considered the Agreed
   Statement of Facts and the submissions of counsel, and accepted the
   Studentâs guilty plea to the charge under s. B.1.3(a) of the Code. At
   the time of the alleged second falsification, the Student had graduated
   from the University.Â  The Panel observed that although it did not have
   jurisdiction to convene a hearing into the second falsification, it
   would have been possible for the University to convene a hearing of its
   Governing Council which would have had the jurisdiction to potentially
   recall the Studentâs degree. The Panel observed that while the parties
   had agreed that the second falsification could be taken into account to
   the extent that the Student had repeated his conduct, the matter before
   the hearing and the penalty to be levied was with respect to the plea
   to one charge only, for the first falsification. The parties submitted
   an Agreed Statement of Facts Relevant to Sanction, which centered on a
   publicized previous falsification incident at the Faculty of Law. The
   Panel considered the Studentâs apology to the firm and his conduct in
   self-reporting himself to the Law Society. The Panel observed that the
   Student was unable to advance towards the Bar so long as the charges
   remained outstanding. The Panel considered previous decisions of the
   Tribunal, including the case of Mr. L. and the case of Mr. Y. and found
   that the Tribunal and its predecessors had imposed expulsion or recall
   of the degree for the falsification of an academic record, and that the
   deception of third parties was emphasised as particularly offensive
   conduct. The Panel found that the Student was a sophisticated and
   senior student who was aware of the traumatic effect of the previous
   forgery incident upon the Faculty; that he had been exposed to both
   academic teaching and practical instruction underlying the requirement
   for ethical behavior; that he had committed himself to uphold the
   standards of integrity at the Rotman School; and that previous
   misrepresentations he had made to the Rotman School occurred after he
   had submitted his falsified transcript to the firm. The Panel found
   that the Studentâs acts of deception and dishonesty were deliberate;
   that he involved a friend in his misconduct; that he perpetrated a
   fraud and deception upon a third party, both as a law student and as a
   law graduate; and that the University suffered from the commission of
   the offence, as it was widely publicized as another failure at the
   Faculty of Law. The Panel recognized the concern of the University for
   a penalty that would act as a deterrent, having regard to the publicity
   that the matter had generated. The Panel found that the Studentâs
   character was highly relevant to its disposition.Â  The Panel
   considered how the Student dealt with the facts surrounding the
   incident; his post incident conduct; his circumstances at the time of
   the hearing; and the character evidence presented by a representative
   of the Studentâs former law firm and the opinion of a well respected
   lawyer. The Panel considered the principle goal of reformation and
   found that on all the evidence, including its assessment of the
   Studentâs response to questions and demeanour in the witness box, the
   Student could be fully rehabilitated, and that he should be given the
   opportunity to continue on towards an eventual call to the Bar, should
   the Law Society permit him to do so. The Panel imposed a three-year
   suspension; a permanent notation on the Studentâs academic record; and
   that a report be issued to the Provost.

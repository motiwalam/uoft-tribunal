Reasons for Decision
Delivered by Ms. Roslyn M. Tsao

1.

The Trial division of the Tribunal heard this matter on August 6, 2013. The Student was
charged on October 30, 2012 of 22 charges relating to the forging, altering or falsifying
of documents or evidence on 7 or 8 separate submissions to the Committee on Standing

-2("Committee") in support of petitions for late withdrawal from courses in two separate
academic years.
2.

The Hearing proceeded by way of an Agreed Statement of Facts ("ASF") (attached as
Appendix 1) and with the University withdrawing 4 of the 22 charges.'

3.

The Student did not attend at the Hearing.

Facts of the Case

4.

A summary of the agreed facts set out in the ASF are:
(a)

In July 2008, the Student submitted a petition to the Committee on Standing,
Faculty of Arts and Science, seeking late withdrawal without academic penalty
from 10 courses in which he had enrolled in academic year 2007-2008 ("Petition
1").

The Committee granted his request based on the reasons given by the

Student, namely, that his grandfather in Sri Lanka was ill and eventually passed
away and that he had to spend a significant portion of his first term in Sri Lanka
and when he returned to Canada, he had to take additional part-time work because
his parents remained abroad to look after his grandmother.
(b)

The University accepted the documents provided by the Student in support of
Petition 1 without confirming their authenticity.

The Student has now

acknowledged that he knowingly forged and falsified the application for extended
leave of absence, a letter requesting a leave of absence from work and a document
titled Human Resources Recommendations.
(c)

The following year in May, 2009, the Student submitted another petition to the
Committee seeking late withdrawal without academic penalty from 7 courses in
which he had enrolled in academic year 2008-2009 (''Petition 2 ").

(d)

The reasons and documentation provided by the Student in support of Petition 2
were that he was "neglectful and self-destructive" .... "pretty spaced out" ...

1 Charges 11, 12, 13 and 22 were withdrawn.

-3-

"mostly stayed home and (sic) video games all day". The Student submitted a
medical certificate which he now admits was knowingly forged.
(e)

Petition 2 was denied by the Committee, finding:
You have not presented compelling reasons for not withdrawing before
the deadline for withdrawal ·without academic penalty. You have already
been granted late withdrawal without academic penalty from all the
courses fi·om your previous year of study and you were clearly warned of
your responsibility to assess your progress in courses and to drop them
to avoidfi1rther academic penalty.

(f)

The Student submitted a further petition in September, 2009 seeking the same
relief as was sought in Petition 2 ("Petition 3"). The personal statement submitted
in Petition 3 was wholly different and inconsistent from that submitted with
Petition 2. In particular, the Student claimed that his grandmother passed away in
August, 2009 and, in support of this, submitted a Certificate of Death and
application for translation of a death certificate. The Student now admits that
these two documents were forged, altered and/or falsified.

(g)

In October, 2009, the Student submitted another personal statement in support of
his Petitions 2 and 3, accompanied by a newspaper death notice for his
grandmother. The Student now admits that the newspaper death notice which he
proffered as evidence of his grandmother's death related to another unrelated third
party.

(h)

The Student submitted another personal statement in April 2012 in further support
of Petition 3.

The Student wanted to follow up on the status of his "long

outstanding petition".
(i)

The Student now admits that his Petition 1, Petition 2 and Petition 3 forms and
personal statements contained false and misleading information and statements in
an attempt to obtain academic advantage.

(i)

Finally, on May 31, 2012, the Student emailed a Petitions Officer at the
University in response to her question regarding the newspaper death notice, with
further false statements designed to mislead the university.

-4Decision of the Tribunal

5.

Based on the foregoing admitted facts, the Tribunal finds the Student guilty of the
charges (except those withdrawn by the University).

Penalty

6.

The Student and University submitted the following joint submission regarding penalty:
(a)

The Student will receive final grade of zero in the 17 courses which were the
subject matter of Petitions 1 and 2;

(b)

The Student will be immediately suspended from the University for a period of up
to five years from the date of the order, and that a corresponding permanent
notation be placed on his academic record and transcript; and

(c)
7.

The Tribunal should report the decision to the Provost for publication.

The University stressed that because the Student admitted the facts and his guilt to all 22
charges, as set out in the ASF, the requirement of putting the University to the task of
proving the allegations was avoided and that significant time and effort was saved.

8.

There was an Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission on Penalty ("ASF/JSP")
(attached as Appendix 2).

9.

The Student has been sanctioned for academic misconduct on two prior occasions:
(a)

In the summer of 2009, the Student admitted that he committed plagiarism in an
assignment worth 10% of his final grade. This matter (which predated the within
charges) was addressed at the department level and the Student received a zero on
the assignment; and

(b)

In the summer of 2012, the Student again admitted that he committed plagiarism
in an assignment and attempted to withdraw from the course. The matter was
addressed by the Dean's Designate on July 2, 2012 with a zero on the assignment
and a final grade reduction by 7 marks.

- 510.

It was in or about the time of the second plagiarism charge that the University
investigated the previous Petitions submitted by the Student.

11.

The Student did not attend at the hearing to provide any other submissions regarding
mitigation.

12.

The Panel considered some of the documentation included m the Joint Book of
Documents (Exhibit 3) in the context of penalty:
(a)

In May, 2009, the Student had been accepted to Ross University, a Caribbean
medical school, which the Student states, accepts students with grade averages of
50% with a sufficiently high MCAT score.2

(b)

His stated reason for the requested late withdrawal was "to get a min GP A of 1.85
to get off probations because I need to get a course overload for the summer
and/or for the fall ... because I got accept (sic) to Ross University Medical
School.."

(c)

As recently as May 31, 2012, after being sanctioned for plagiarism in May 2009,
the Student continued to make (elaborate) false and misleading statements to the
Petitions Officer for academic advantage (e.g. explaining why the newspaper
death notice of his "grandmother" does not refer to him by name because his
name in Sri Lankan is different than what he uses here).

(d)

The Student's email of May 31, 2012 to the Petitions Officer also indicates that he
will be starting "clinicals" after August 18th and will be unavailable until the
summer of next year, which leads the panel to suspect that he has likely
completed a medical program at Ross University given the 4 academic years that
have elapsed from his acceptance in May 2009.

2

See Personal Statement of Student submitted with Petition 2 filed May 22, 2009.

-613.

The Student has demonstrated a cavalier disdain for the ethics of this or any academic
institution and his false statements, misrepresentations and fabrications are not isolated to
one incident or a brief period of time but span years.

14.

After being allowed to late withdraw from 10 courses (Petition 1) in one year, the Student
looked "a gift horse in the mouth" and doubled down the following year by seeking to
late withdraw again from his entire course load --- solely on the basis of false and
misleading statements to the Committee. Even after the Student committed plagiarism on
an assignment and was sanctioned in 2009, he continued to submit false and misleading
statements and documents and committed a second instance of plagiarism.

15.

There are too many examples of the Student's disregard for integrity and responsibility
and it shocks the conscience of the Panel that such behaviour could warrant anything less
than a recommendation for expulsion.

16.

The Panel is very reluctant, in most circumstances, to reject a joint submission on
penalty. However, the Panel is of the view that the penalty proposed in this matter would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute and would condone the Student's
misconduct.

17.

University counsel provided 2 decisions in support of the Joint Submission on Penalty.
The decision in ~ is distinguishable as the Student had no prior
academic offences, admitted guilt at the Dean's meeting and suffered from depression.
The decision in

ull is also distinguishable in that the Student had no prior discipline

history and attended at the hearing to offer mitigating submissions.

7.

On July 14, 2008, Mr. ~ filed a petition to the Committee on Standing at the

3

9.

By submitting the petition form , Mr. ' = - affirmed that he had provided accurate

and complete information with the 2008 Petition.
10.

In his personal statement in support of the petition, Mr. ' = - wrote:
The reasons for this is that mid October my dad heard his father had become ill
and become hospitalized. As an only child he and the rest of us left to sri lanka
to see him, being he had pneumonia and his age. He was pretty sick. After
arriving in sri-lanka I believe it was on the 241\ we did the customary meet and
greet with the relatives and their best wis_hes. My grandfather was hospitalized
till early December, getting better he was released. His health better, we decided
to leave before the end of December, but shortly after his release. He fell ill, and
was readmitted . He stayed under observation at the Colombo General Hospital.
On Jan. 24th he died in his sleep. My father decided to stay in srilanka with my
grandmother because she isn't doing well after her husband's death. As a result
my parents are currently living in srilanka, since putting her in a home is both
very expensive and not good because the quality of elderly homes in Srilanka is
not very good. I arrived in Canada on February 9th.
You might ask why didn't you cancel your courses in October, in all honesty I
only expected to stay for 2 weeks max, and there weren't any tests coming up so
I thought I'd come back in time. But his health was worse than expected and it
turned into an extended stay. Between the hospital visits and paying the hospital
fee's and tracking down doctors who disappear, I totally forgot about school.
Again you might ask why didn't you cancel your s_econd term courses, when I got
back I didn't even remember school, we had gone to Srilanka in peak season
with a loan, and since my dad is retired ar:id my mom left her job in Canada went
back to teaching in Srilanka. I had to get a part-time job on top of my current
part-time job as a security guard. As a result I am busy 5nites a week and I am
busy 4 days out of the working week. I get a letter from woods worth saying I've
been put on academic probation.

11.

The University accepted the documents provided by Mr. ' = - without confirming

their authenticity. On November 24, 2009, the Committee granted the 2008 Petition and granted
him late withdrawal without academic penalty in the 1O courses. A copy of the petition decision
is included in the JBD at Tab 5.
12.

Mr. ' = - admits that he filed the 2008 Petition knowing that it contained some false

information, including, but not limited to the asserted explanation for needed to drop the courses
after the drop date.
13.

Mr. ~ admits that he knowingly forged and falsified the application for an

extended leave of absence, the letter requesting a leave of absence from work, and the

4

document titled Human Resources Recommendations documents and that he circulated them
knowing that they were forged and falsified and did so to obtain an academic advantage.

a University of Toronto Medical School Certificate, which was dated June 11, 2009. A copy of
the 2008 Petition is included in the JBD at Tab 6.

the petition decision is included in the JDB at Tab 7. The decision read as follows:

deadline for withdrawal without academic penalty. You have already been
granted late withdrawal without academic penalty from all the courses from your
previous year of study and you were clearly warned of your responsibility to
assess your progress in courses and to · drop them to avoid further academic

Petition. A copy of this document is included in the JBD at Tab 11. . Mr. ~ admits that
he knew that the April 2012 Personal Statement that he submitted contained false statements
relating to his reasons for failing to withdraw from his courses within the required time.

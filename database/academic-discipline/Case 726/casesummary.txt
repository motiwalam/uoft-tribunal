   Grievances
   Trial Division â s. B.i.3(a) of the Code â falsified documents and
   forged academic records â document purporting to be degree certificate
   â Â documents sent to employer falsifying possession of degrees â
   Â Student did not attend hearing â Student given reasonable notice of
   Hearing â agreed statement of facts â finding of guilt â high end of
   spectrum regarding seriousness of offence â five-year suspension;
   recommendation that the Student be expelled; permanent notation on
   transcript; report to Provost for publication
   The Trial Division of the Tribunal was convened on November 20, 2013 to
   consider charges laid against the Student by a letter dated September
   9, 2013 from the Vice-Provost, Faculty and Academic Life. The charges
   were revised on September 17, 2013. The Student and the University
   entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF). The Student did not
   attend the hearing but had received reasonable notice.
   Student charged with three offences under s. B.i.3(a) of the Code . The
   charges related to allegations that the Student had forged and
   falsified several documents. These were a document purporting to be an
   Honours Bachelorâs degree certificate in Business Administration, a
   cover letter and resume in which the Student claimed to have earned the
   degree of Honours Bachelor of Business Administration, and a cover
   letter and resume in which the Student claimed to have earned the
   degree of Master of Business Administration. Discipline Counsel
   provided an overview of the ASF via which the Student entered a guilty
   plea. The Tribunal accepted the guilty plea and the Student stood
   convicted on the three charges.
   The University submitted that the sanction here should include a
   recommendation of expulsion due to the severity of the misconduct.
   Discipline Counsel presented a Brief of Authorities suggesting that,
   where a transcript was forged, the resulting sanction resulted in a
   five year suspension, recommendation for expulsion or revocation of a
   degree. Discipline Counsel cited University of Toronto and Mr. C.
   (November 5, 1976/77-3) and suggested that forging a degree moves the
   case to the high end of the spectrum regarding seriousness of offence.
   While the Student admitted misconduct and agreed to the ASF, he did not
   attend the hearing or present any mitigating circumstances. Aggravating
   circumstances included the forgery of the certificate and the false
   representation that the Student had earned the two degrees. It was
   difficult to ascertain if the Student would be likely to reoffend. The
   Panel imposed a five-year suspension, recommended that the Student be
   expelled from the University, ordered a permanent notation on the
   Studentâs transcript and ordered that the case be reported to the
   Provost for publication.

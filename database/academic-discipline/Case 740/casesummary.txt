   purchased onlineâ documents requesting inappropriate academic
   accommodation â Â Student attended hearing â Student expressed remorse
   and was forthright â Â finding of guilt â Joint Submission on Penalty â

   Student charged with nine offences under s. B.i.1(a) and in the
   alternative, one offence under s. B.i.3(a) of the Code . The charges
   related to allegations that the student had knowingly falsified several
   documents, namely Petitions, Personal Statements, and a Verification of
   Student Illness or Injury Forms, on three occasions to request academic
   accommodation in three courses. These materials included forged medical
   notes purchased from an online service. The Student met with a
   University representative and admitted committing the academic
   offenses, that she purchased and submitted the notes, and that her
   Personal Statements were false. She also provided the contact
   information of the individual who sold her the notes and receipts from
   two of the transactions. The Student attended the hearing without
   counsel, signed the Agreement, and plead guilty to all ten charges.
   Â The Panel accepted the Studentâs guilty pleas and the University
   withdrew the alternative charge. The parties presented a Joint
   Submission on Penalty. The Panel noted that the Student had no prior
   findings of academic dishonesty against her, had been fulsome and
   forthright and demonstrated a degree of insight and remorse. The Panel
   accepted the joint submission and imposed a final grade of zero in the
   three courses, a suspension of five years to start on the date the
   Tribunal make its order, a notation on the Studentâs transcript for six
   years, and ordered that the case be reported to the Provost for
   publication.

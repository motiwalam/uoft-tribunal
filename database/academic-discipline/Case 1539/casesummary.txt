   The Student was charged for offences related to two separate courses
   (hereinafter, the ‚First Course‚ and ‚Second Course‚, and collectively
   ‚the Courses‚). The Student was charged with two counts of knowingly
   possessing an unauthorized aid and/or obtaining unauthorized assistance
   in connection with the final exams in the Courses, contrary to section
   B.i.1(b) of the Code . The Student was also charged with two counts of
   knowingly representing as their own an idea or work of another in
   connection with the final exams in the Courses, contrary to section
   B.i.1(d) of the Code . In the alternative to the foregoing charges, the
   Student was charged with two counts of knowingly engaging in a form of
   cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
   not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit
   or other academic advantage of any kind in connection with the final
   exams in the Courses, contrary to section B.i.3(b) of the Code.

   Neither the Student nor any representative on their behalf appeared at
   the hearing. The University requested that the Tribunal proceed with
   the hearing in the Student‚s absence and presented affidavit evidence
   in support of that submission. The Panel heard evidence that the
   Student had participated in a Dean‚s Designate meeting and admitted
   guilt, and attempts were made by the University and Assistant
   Discipline Counsel (‚ADC‚) to notify the Student of the Tribunal
   process by phone and by email. Assistant An immigration advisor
   responded to ADC and advised the University that it should inform the
   Student regarding the hearing date and time. ADC attempted to call the
   Student and both couriered and emailed information regarding the
   hearing to the Student. Based on the evidence presented, the Tribunal
   was satisfied that the University had discharged its obligation under
   the Rules of Practice and Procedure to provide reasonable notice
   regarding the charges and the hearing. As a result, the hearing
   proceeded in the absence of the Student.

   The Panel was presented with three affidavits with evidence to support
   the University‚s case at the offence phase. During the final exam for
   the First Course, the Student was found to be wearing a miniature
   camera poking out of a buttonhole in her jacket and connected to a
   cellphone that was turned on. During the final exam for the second
   Course, three days later, the Student was found to be wearing tiny
   earpieces in her ears, which were connected to a cell phone. In advance
   of the Dean‚s Designate meeting, the Student responded to an email from
   the Academic Integrity Unit admitting to committing offences in both of
   the Courses. During the Dean‚s Designate meeting the Student again
   admitted to using a cellphone with a camera and wearing an earpiece
   during the final exams in both Courses, and that she was being provided
   hints by other people during the exams, namely a tutoring service paid
   for by the Student. The Student pled guilty to the charges in
   connection with the final exams in both courses. Given the affidavit
   evidenced, the Panel concluded that there was clear and convincing
   evidence of the Student‚s guilt for two counts of knowingly using and
   possessing an unauthorized aid or aids and/or obtaining unauthorized
   assistance in connection with the final exams in the Courses, contrary
   to section B.I.1(b) of the Code. The University withdrew the remaining
   charges.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered affidavit
   evidence tendered by the University outlining the Student‚s prior
   academic offence, also for obtaining unauthorized assistance during a
   final exam, for which the Student was sanctioned. The Panel further
   consider the sanctioning factors outlined in the decision in University
   of Toronto and Mr. C (Case No. 1976/77- 3, November 5, 1976). The Panel
   noted, with respect to the Student‚s character, that there was no
   positive character evidence, or any direct evidence of extenuating
   circumstances. The Panel did, however, find that the Student‚s prior
   commission of a similar academic offence, and the repetition of the
   offences that were at issue in this case ‚ within days of one another ‚
   weighed in favour of a significant sanction, and suggested a strong
   likelihood of a repetition of the offence if the Student was given
   another opportunity to attend the University. The Panel also noted that
   this offence involved a commercial element as the Student paid a
   tutoring service to assist them with cheating on the final exams, and
   that consistent with prior Tribunal decisions, such offences require a
   strong deterrent to discourage others from committing the offence. The
   Panel was satisfied that the penalty requested by the University was
   reasonable and appropriate.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a recommendation to the
   President of the University that the President recommend to the
   Governing Council that the Student be expelled from the University; an
   immediate suspension for up to five years or until the Governing
   Council makes its decision on expulsion; a final grade of zero in the
   Courses; and a report to the Provost for publication.

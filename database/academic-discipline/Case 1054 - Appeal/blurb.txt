Discipline Appeals Board – Student appeals finding of guilty arguing Tribunal erred in allowing the University to call reply evidence – University cross-appeals acquittal of a charge under s. B.i.1(a) of the Code – R. v. Krause, [1986] 2 SCR 466 - R. v. Sanderson, 2017 ONCA 470 - it is an important element of a fair hearing that the University should not split its case, leading in reply evidence that it could and should have made part of its initial case against a student - in general terms, the principles enunciated in cases such as R. v. Krause and R. v. Sanderson, 2017 ONCA 470 apply. However, the Tribunal is not bound by the strict rules of evidence and there have been in the past, and there may in the future be, circumstances where fairness justifies the calling of reply evidence which might not be permitted in a criminal case - no obligation on the University to prove the contents of the Agreed Statement of Facts and  it would be unwise and a waste of hearing resources to have multiple witnesses confirm facts that the parties have agreed to - as soon as the Tribunal found that the Student’s conduct is an offence under s. B.i.1(a) of the Code, the offence under  s. B.i.3(b) ceases to apply.

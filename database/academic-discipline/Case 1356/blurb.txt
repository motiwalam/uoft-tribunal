Trial Division – ss. B.i.1(c) and B.i.1(b) of Code – personation – unauthorized assistance – Student admitted paid a “tutor” to write a test and another individual to assist with a final exam – Agreed Statement of Fact (“ASF”) – Student testified that they committed these offences in their freshman year which was a difficult time for them as they were attending school remotely from another country – the charges were proven with clear and convincing evidence on a balance of probabilities – guilty plea accepted – the penalty requested by the Student was insufficient to address the conduct and resulting harm to the University – the Student committed very serious offences – preventing this type of offence from occurring is critical to ensuring that a University of Toronto degree is earned and cannot be bought – mitigating factors were present – a grade of zero in the courses; a five-year suspension; a six-year notation on the transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

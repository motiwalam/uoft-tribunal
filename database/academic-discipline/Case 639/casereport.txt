5)

In DecembetÂ· 2010, the Student knowingly forged, altered or falsified a document

which the Student submitted to the Committee in support of the Student's request

7)

On January 14, 2011, the Student knowingly falsified a document or evidence

falsified document, namely, an email that the Student sent to Lee Jeffrey at
Woodsworth College in which the Student claimed that she had a serious illness
during the December 2010 exam period, contrary to section B.I.l(a) of the Code.

8)

On May 4, 2011, the Student knowingly falsified a document or evidence required
by the University of Toronto, or uttered, circulated or made use of any such
falsified document or evidence, namely, a petition form seeking late withdrawal
without academic penalty from two University of Toronto courses BIO120H1F
and MUSI IOHIF, contrary to section B.I.l(a) of the Code.

9)

In May 2011, the Student knowingly falsified a document or evidence required by

In May 2011, the Student knowingly forged, altered or falsified a document or

documents and letters that the Student submitted in support of her petition seeking
late withdrawal without academic penalty from two University of Toronto courses
B1O120H1F and MUSI lOHIF, contrary to section B.I.l(a) of the Code.

11)

In the alternative to each of the charges above, the Student knowingly engaged in
a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain academic
credit or other academic advantage of any kind by submitting falsified or forged
documents to the University of Toronto in support of various forms of academic
accommodation or relief, contrary to section B.I.3(b) of the Code.

The Student attended the hearing, was represented by counsel, and pied guilty to the
above charges. The University indicated that if the plea of guilty to charges 1-10 was
accepted, the final charge would be withdrawn in that it was in the alternative.

Agreed Statement of Facts & Finding on Charges

3.

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the University had entered into
an Agreed Statement of Pacts with the Student. That Agreed Statement is attached as
Appendix A to this decision. The Tribunal also received into evidence, on consent, a
Joint Book of Documents that are referred to in the Agreed Statement of Facts.

-44.

As set out in more detail in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the circumstances giving rise
to the charges involved multiple occasions where the Student applied to be exempted
from deadlines for family or health-related reasons. On two occasions, the Student
submitted petitions to defer unwritten examinations. A further petition was submitted
seeking late withdrawal without academic penalty.

5.

The Student admits that she knew each of the three petitions contained false information.
In the first petition the Student falsely stated that her father was critically ill in China. In
suppm1 of that petition the Student submitted a personal statement that she knew
contained false information regarding her father's purported illness. She also submitted
forged or falsified documents that she knowingly purchased. These forged and falsified
documents were elaborate, including documents purporting to be from a hospital, a
notary public and others in China. The second petition also contained information the
Student knew was false, including a letter that purported to be from an Ontario hospital
that the Student knew was forged and false and a forged student medical certificate
containing false information. The third petition also contained information the Student
knew was false, including the false statement that her father had died. Again, the Student
included a personal statement including false information as well as forged or falsified
documents that she had knowingly purchased. Again, the forged or falsified documents
were elaborate, including for example documents purporting to be a "critical condition
notice" and a "death notice" from a hospital and others in China.

6.

These three petitions were submitted in the period from April 2010 to May 2011. In this
same period, the Student also knowingly provided false information to the University by
claiming in an email that she had a serious illness during the 2010 examination period.

7.

The Student admits that she provided the false information and forged or falsified
documents to the University to obtain an academic advantage, to mislead the instructors,
and expecting that it would be relied upon by the instructors to their detriment and would
provide her with an academic advantage.

8.

After reviewing the facts contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Book of
Documents, the Tribunal deliberated and concluded that the facts demonstrate that the
charges 1-10 above were proved, and agreed to accept the guilty pleas in respect of those
charges. Given that finding, the University withdrew charge 11, and that charge is
therefore not the subject of a finding of this Tribunal.

Penalty

9.

The parties submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty, including further agreed facts,
attached as Appendix B. The Joint Submission proposed that the Student be given a final
grade of zero in the seven courses that were the subject of charges 1-10, be suspended
from the University for five years, and have a notation of her academic record and
transcript for six years. It was also proposed that this case be reported to the Provost for
publication of a notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the
name of the student withheld.

-510.

The Tribunal considered the factors that are to govern its decision, as set out in The
University of Toronto and Mr. C. dated November S, 1976, at p. 12 (File No. 1976/77-3).

11.

The proved charges are very serious, given the nature and extent of the Student's
knowing falsification of documents and the purchase and use of elaborate forged or
falsified documents on multiple occasions. The Student knowingly submitted false
information in relation to a total of seven courses. The false information included
statements that her father was seriously ill, and later that he died, and included numerous
purportedly official documents that were in fact forged and falsified. The Student
admitted to purchasing the forged and falsified documents that she subm.itted with J1er
petitions seeking to defer her examinations. The Student provided the false information
and forged or falsified documents to the University to obtain an academic advantage, to
mislead the instructors, and expecting that it would relied upon to provide her with an
academic advantage.

12.

In suppo1t of the joint submission, the parties asked the Tribunal to take into account the
fact that the Student admitted the charges at an early stage in the process and cooperated
with the University, including by the agreement on the facts in the Agreement Statement
of Facts, by pleading guilty and by the Joint Submission on Penalty. As well, the Student
had no prior discipline history, has shown remorse and testified to the Tribunal about her
intention not to repeat this conduct.

13.

While the Tribunal has taken these mitigating factors into account, absent the joint
submission the Tribunal would have given serious consideration to a more severe
penalty. This pattern of elaborate falsehood, done deliberately to obtain an academic
advantage, is antithetical to the core values expected of students as set out h1 the Code.
However, the Tribunal recognizes that there is a high threshold that must be met for the
Tribunal to reject a joint submission. To meet that threshold, the Tribunal would have to
be of the view that accepting the joint submission would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute (University of Toronto and P. P. dated April 5, 2011, para. 8 (Case
No. 642)). The Tribunal concluded that this is not such a case.

14.

The Tribunal therefore accepted the joint submission on penalty with reluctance.

Decision of the Tribunal
15.

The Tribunal has ordered as follows:
I. THAT Ms.â  is guilty of 10 counts of knowingly fa lsifying evidence required by the
University of Toronto, or circulating such evidence, contrary to section B.1.1(a) of the

3.

At the outset of the hearing, the Tribunal was advised that the matter would proceed on an
Agreed Statement of Facts dated May 9, 2007. (See Appendix!),

4,

The Student, through her representative, pleaded guilty to charges I and 3. Counsel for the
University advised that he was relying on charges 2, 4, and 5 only if the panel was not
prepared to find the Student guilty of charges l and 3.

Decision of the Tribu11al

5.

After reviewing the Agreed Statement of Facts, and hearing submissions from both parties,
the Tribunal accepted the plea and found that the facts support findings of contraventions
of the Code as set out in charges I and 3. Accordingly, the panel found the Student guilty
of charges I and 3 and delivered its decision orally at the hearing, The University
withdrew the remaining charges.

Penalty Phase

6.

The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission on Penalty,
dated May 9, 2007. (See Appendix 2). The following sanctions were recommended in the
joint submission:
•

assigm11ent of a grade of zero in:
PHL340H5 (lssues in Philosophy of Mind) for the 2006 Winter term
PSY2l 3H5 (Adult Development and Aging) for the 2006 Winter term;

•

suspension from attendance at the University of Toronto for a period of 3
years, from June 23, 2006 to June 23, 2009;

•

notation on the Student's transcript for a period of 3 years, from June 23, 2006
to June 23, 2009, to the effect that she was sanctioned for academic
misconduct;

•

report to the Provost, who may publish a notice of the decision of the Tribunal
and the sanction or sanctions imposed with the Student's name withheld.

7.

The panel inquired about the reasoning behind the penalty, especially the leniency of the
penalty in respect of the plagiarism offence. Discipline counsel explained that there were
two mitigating factot·s in the Student's favour: J) she admitted guilt early in the process
and cooperated fully with the University; 2) the two offences occurred at approximately the
same time with no intervention between the two, Therefore, the University is satisfied that
the proposed penalty will send an adequate message to convey the seriousness of the
offences, yet will permit the rehabilitation of the academic relationship between the
Student and the University. Discipline counsel expressed confidence in the proposed
penalty as a means of vindicating the academic integrity of the University.

8.

The panel acknowledges the factors identified by counsel and, in our view, the penalty
suggested in the joint submission is appropriate and we so order:
•

Final grades of zero shall be assigned in:
PHL340H5 (Issues in Philosophy of Mind) for the 2006 Winter term
PSY213H5 (Adult Development and Aging) for the 2006 Wintet· term;

3

•

The Student shall be suspended from attendance at the University of Toronto
for a period of 3 years, from June 23, 2006 to June 23, 2009;

•

A notation shall be placed on the Student's transcript for a period of 3 years,
from June 23, 2006 to June 23, 2009, to the effect that she was sanctioned for
academic misconduct;

•

A report shall be made to the Provost, who may publish a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed with the
Student's name withheld.

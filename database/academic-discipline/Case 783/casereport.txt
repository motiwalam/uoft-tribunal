REASONS FOR DECISION
1.

The Trial Division of the University of Toronto Tribunal was convened on

April 30, 2015 to consider charges advanced by the University of Toronto (the
"University") against -

(A■)

-ra (the "Student") under the Code of

Behaviour on Academic Matters (the "Code").

PART 1 - THE CHARGES
2.

The Student is charged with three offences under the Code:

(1) On or about December 2, 2013, you knowingly represented as your own an
idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another, in an essay that
you submitted for academic credit in GGR365H5S: Trade and Globalization
(the "Course"), contrary to section B.1.1 (d) of the Code.
(2) On or about December 2, 2013, you knowingly obtained unauthorized
assistance in connection with an essay that you submitted for academic
credit in the Course, contrary to section B.1.1 (b) of the Code.
(3) In the alternative, on or about December 2, 2013, you knowingly engaged in
a form

of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud

or

misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain
academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind, in connection with
an essay you submitted for academic credit in the Course, contrary to section
B.l.3(b) of the Code.

PART2 - AGREEDSTATEMENTOFFACTSAND PLEA
3.

At the outset of the hearing, Discipline Counsel advised that the University

and the Student had entered into an Ag reed Statement of Facts. The Agreed
Statement of Facts is attached hereto as Appendix "A".

2

4.

Pursuant to the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student pied guilty to all

three charges listed above.

Discipline Counsel advised that if the Tribunal

accepted the plea on either of the first two charges then the University withdrew
the third charge.
5.

The Student admitted that she purchased an essay for use in the Course

(the "Purchased Essay"), and that she knowingly obtained unauthorized
assistance and represented as her own work, the work of another person in
submitting an essay in the Course (the "Review Essay").

The particular

admissions are as follows:
(a)

She copied four full paragraphs directly from the Purchased Essay;

(b)

She copied the ideas and expressions in the book and back page
of the Goldin/Reinert Book;

(c)

She failed to attribute these verbatim and nearly verbatim excerpts
appropriately; and

(d)

She did so to obtain academic credit in GGR365H5S, and with the
intention that the University rely on it as containing her own work
and ideas in considering the appropriate academic credit to be
assigned to her work.

6.

The Student was in attendance via Skype as she was currently residing in

her home country of China and confirmed that she pied guilty to the charges as

3

provided for in the Agreed Statement of Facts.

She was also represented by

counsel in Toronto, who was in attendance in person at the hearing.
7.

The details of the charges are set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts

and supported by the documents contained in the Joint Book of Documents. The
essential elements of the charges and the supporting facts are set out below.
PART 3 - THE FACTS UNDERLYING THE CHARGES
8.

In the Fall of 2013, the Student enrolled in the Course, which was taught

by Professor Pierre Desrochers. The syllabus for the Course, which the Student
received, advised the students that they would be required to submit their papers
to Turnitin.com for review of textual similarity. The syllabus also discussed the
issue of "academic integrity/honesty or academic offences" with a reference to
the Code.
9.

The academic requirements for the Course provided for the submission of

a 15-page essay or book review, which would be worth 40% of the final grade in
the Course. Professor Desrochers approved the topic for essay or book review
of each student. Once approval was obtained, the Student was then required to
submit a formal paper proposal, which the Professor graded and returned to the
Student (the "Review Essay Proposal").

The Review Essay Proposal, due on

September 30, 2014, was worth 5% of the Course mark.
10.

The Student emailed Professor Desrochers on September 18, 2013 to

identify a book that she had chosen for her book review.

On September 24,

2013, the Student again emailed Professor Desrochers to advise him that she
4

had changed her book choice to a book called Globalization for Development:
Trade, Finance, Aid, Migration and Policy by Ian Goldin and Kenneth Reinert (the

"Golden/Reinert Book"). Professor Desrochers approved this book choice.
11.

As required, the Student submitted her Review Essay Proposal on the

Goldin/Reinert Book, which was marked and returned to her.
12.

On November 16, 2013, an individual named James Risdon advised the

University that he was aware that a student in a geography course at the
University of Toronto was attempting to cheat in such course by paying someone
to write a paper for him/her in GGR365, Trade and Globalization. Mr. Risdon
indicated that he subscribed to a company that takes orders for freelance writers
to compose papers for students.
13.

Mr. Risdon provided certain details of the basis for his concern. He

provided the instructions that had been given with respect to this paper, including
the need for a Review Essay on a book called "Ian Glodin" [sic] and Kenneth
Reinert (2007) Globalization for Development: Trade, Finance, Aid, Migration and
Policy. World Bank Publications. Second Edition."
14.

The instructions provided by the student were: "It is a 40% essay, please

right [sic] it in good quality, and also quote anything that is not in your own words,
because this assignment will hand in on Turnitin.com!!!

Please send me the

finished essay by Nov 20, 2013." The instructions also indicated that there would
be "absolutely NO copy/paste NO plagiarism".

5

15.

In his email, Mr. Risdon also attached the review essay evaluation sheet

from the Course, which is identical to the document provided by Professor
Desrochers to students in that Course.

He also provided the Review Essay

Proposal, which was identical to the Review Essay Proposal submitted by the
Student, but for the title and Student's name and Student number as well as UTM
Department of Geography 2013 GGR365H5S: Trade and Globalization 15-page
review essay detailed instructions, which is the same as that provided to the
students in the Course.
16.

The electronic metadata for the documents revealed that Professor

Desrochers is the author of the Review Essay evaluation sheet, the Student is
the author of the posted Review Essay Proposal, and the Student is the author of
the posted essay instructions.
17.

On December 2, 2013, the Student submitted the Review Essay entitled

Globalization for Development: Trade, Finance, Aid, Migration and Policy.

18.

On February 19, 2014, the Student attended a meeting with the Dean's

designate via Skype, as she was out of the country. She denied that she had
paid to have an original essay created for her for the course. Upon being told
that the University had email evidence substantiating the allegations, the Student
admitted to having purchased an essay.
PART 4 - DECISION ON CHARGES
19.

The Tribunal reviewed the Agreed Statement Facts, the documents in

support thereof and considered the submissions of Discipline Counsel and
6

counsel for the Student.

After deliberations, the Tribunal determined the

evidence proved Charges 1 and 2, and accepted the guilty plea entered by the
Student.
20.

As a result, the University withdrew Charge 3. The Tribunal makes no

findings or determinations with respect to this Charge.
PART 5 - PENALTY
21.

The University and the Student submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty.

The Joint Submission on Penalty is attached to these Reasons as Appendix
"B". It submits that the University Tribunal impose the following sanctions on the
Student:
(a)

a final grade of zero in GGR365H5S in the 2013 Fall term;

(b)

a suspension from the University to commence April 30, 2015, and
to end April 29, 2020; and

(c)

a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript
from the date of the Order until her graduation from the University.

22.

The parties further submitted that it is appropriate for the University

Tribunal to report this case to the Provost for publication on a notice of the
Decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University
newspapers, with the name of the Student withheld.

7

23.

In oral submissions, Discipline Counsel emphasized the seriousness of

the offence, including that the Student purchased an original essay, a fact which
cannot be readily detected by professors at the University.

In th is case, the

Student's wrongdoing likely would have gone undetected but for the information
provided by Mr. Risdon. The offence requires that the University impose strong
sanctions to reflect both the seriousness of the offence, its effect on the
University environment and the need to provide for general deterrence.
24.

The Tribunal is mindful that there is a high threshold for rejecting a Joint

Submission on Penalty. To reject such a submission, the Tribunal would have to
hold that accepting the Joint Submission on Penalty would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. This is not such a case.
25.

Discipline Counsel referred the Tribunal to cases in which students were

charged with and pied guilty to the purchase of essays. The leading authority on
the sanctions for the purchased essay offences is the Discipline Appeals Board' s
decision in University of Toronto v. ~ ~ n d

J9 (Case Nos. 596, 597 &

598; February 6, 2012). In that case, the Discipline Appeals Board concluded
that purchased essay offences are "about as serious as can be committed in a
University setting". The Appeals Board directed that the working assumption
should be that expulsion from the University is generally the appropriate sanction
for these offences. The Discipline Appeals Board set out the factors to consider
but did note that each case must be decided on its own facts .

8

26.

As Discipline Counsel noted, this case is instructive but not dispositive as

the Student only used part of the Purchased Essay and did complete much of the
Assignment on her own. This distinguishes the case from most purchased essay
offences and supports a lesser sentence than the working assumption of
expulsion.
27.

As Discipline Counsel submitted, an aggravating factor in this case is that

the Student had a prior offence. There were, however, also several mitigating
factors, including that the Student admitted guilt early on at the Dean's meeting,
cooperated with the University and pied guilty to the charges. The Student also
had a difficult year personally that included health problems as well as the
acrimonious divorce of her parents, which the student was forced to mediate
during the night (which is daytime in China). These mitigating factors support the
reasonableness of the penalty and not the harsher penalty of expulsion.
28.

The agreed upon penalty reflects the seriousness of the offence, its effect

on the University and the objective of general deterrence. It also appropriately
takes into account the nature of this offence as a "partial" purchased essay and
the mitigating factors.
PART 6 - THE ORDER

29.

The University Tribunal makes the following order:
(a)

a final grade of zero in GGR365H5S in the 2013 Fall term;

9

(b)

a suspension from the University to commence April 30, 2015, and
to end April 29, 2020;

(c)

a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript
from the date of the Order until her graduation from the University;
and

(d)

that it is appropriate for the University Tribunal to report this case to
the Provost for publication on a notice of the Decision of the
Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed in the University
newspapers, with the name of the Student withheld.

   Trial Division â S.B.i.3(a) of Code â forging or falsifying an academic
   record â teaching assistant who altered his brotherâs marks â Student
   plead guilty on September 10, 2009 â sanction imposed on December 9,
   2009 â this decision provides supplementary reasons for those sanctions
   â sentencing factors in Mr. C case â mitigating circumstances of
   remorse, good character, academic record, lack of personal benefit, and
   possibility of rehabilitation â abuse of position and trust as a
   teaching assistant â deterrence â detriment to the University â case
   distinguished from University of Toronto and S.L. (January 21, 2010) in
   which a teaching assistant received money in exchange for answers â
   case distinguished from University of Toronto and M.C. (July 8, 2008)
   where a student tampered with Universityâs computer system to alter her
   marks

   The Student was charged with three offences under s.B.i.3(a) of the
   Code. On January 14, 2009, the Panel issued a decision responding to
   the Studentâs challenge of the Panelâs jurisdiction. September 10, 2009
   the Student pled guilty to these charges. On October 9, 2009 the Panel
   issued a decision accepting the Studentâs guilty plea. A sanction
   hearing occured on December 9, 2009 and sanctions were imposed on that
   date. This decision provides supplementary reasons for those sanctions.
   The allegations related to forging or falsifying the marks of another
   student, the Studentâs brother, on three different dates. The sanctions
   imposed on December 9, 2009 were a five year suspension, beginning at
   the time that the offences were discovered on April 8, 2008; a five
   year transcript notation; and a report to the Provost for publication.
   The Panel referred to the sentencing factors in the Mr. C case. The
   Panel took into account the Studentâs remorse, good character, and
   academic record. The Panel also took into account the Studentâs abuse
   of position and trust as a teaching assistant. The need for deterrence
   and the detriment to the University was also considered. Expulsion was
   not recommended by the Panel because the Student did not act for his
   own benefit and the possibility of rehabilitation was recognized. This
   case was distinguished from The University of Toronto and S.L. (January
   21, 2010), in which a teaching assistant received money in exchange for
   answers on multiple occasions, and from The University of Toronto and
   M.C. (July 8, 2008), in which a student abused her position of trust to
   tamper with the Universityâs computer system to alter her transcript.

Case #59

   DATE : October 30, 2000

   PARTIES: University of Toronto v. Mr. C.

   HEARING DATE: October 10, 2000

   Panel Members:
   J. Hannaford, Chair

   Appearances:
   T. Costigan, Counsel for C
   L. Rothstein, Senior Discipline Counsel

   The Student attended a final examination at the University and
   presented himself as T.P., another student. The Student wrote the final
   examination in T.P.âs name and under his student number, and was found
   guilty of impersonation.

   The Panel did not find any extenuating circumstances at all with
   respect to the Student. It noted the difficulty in locating the Student
   which may have contributed to the delay in having the matters brought
   to trial. The Panel recommended expulsion from the University; and
   publication by the Provost of a notice of the decision and sanction
   imposed with the Studentâs name withheld.

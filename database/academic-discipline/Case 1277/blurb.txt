Trial Division – s. B.i.1(d) of the Code – two counts of plagiarism – Student knowingly represented as her own an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another in an assignment and a final exam – Student did not appear – s. 7 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act (“SPPA”) – rule 17 of the University Tribunal’s Rules of Practice and Procedure (“Rules”) – notice was properly provided in accordance with the Rules and therefore, ordered the hearing to proceed in the Student’s absence – finding of guilt – the Student copied many of the sentences and passages, and paraphrased others without citation – the penalty was adjusted because there appeared to be a substantial delay between the incident itself and the scheduling of the hearing, and to ensure consistency with the effective lengths of the suspensions – the University has a lot of control over when academic discipline matters come to a hearing and there is nothing wrong with that, or with counsel setting a date that is convenient to them – counsel’s convenience should not be permitted to have an adverse impact on when the student may re-enroll after a suspension – final grade of zero in the course; a three-year suspension; a four-year notation on transcript; and a report to the Provost for publication.

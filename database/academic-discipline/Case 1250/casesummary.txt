   The Student was charged with one count of knowingly having another
   person personate them in connection with a final examination in a
   course (the ‚Course‚), contrary to section B.i.1(c) of the Code . In
   the alternative, the Student was charged with one count of knowingly
   using or possessing an unauthorized aid or obtaining unauthorized
   assistance, contrary to s. B.i.1(b) of the Code. In the further
   alternative, the Student was charged with one count under s. B.i.3(b)
   of the Code for knowingly engaged in a form of cheating, academic
   dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation not otherwise
   described in the Code in order to obtain academic credit or other
   academic advantage of any kind in connection with the final examination
   in the Course.

   The Student was enrolled in the Course and was required to write a
   final examination. The Student admitted that they hired and paid
   another individual to write the exam on their behalf. An individual
   attended the exam, purported to be the Student, and wrote the exam on
   his behalf and was caught by an invigilator when they appeared to use a
   cellphone during the exam. The Student accepted liability for the
   charge, and as a result, the Provost withdrew the alternative charges.
   The Panel accepted the Student‚s admission and concluded that the
   Student had violated s. B.i.1(c) of the Code.

   In determining the appropriate sanction, the Panel considered a joint
   submission on penalty made by the Student and the University. The Panel
   noted that a joint submission should be rejected only where truly
   unreasonable and unconscionable. The Panel decided, in light of the
   Student‚s prior history of serious academic misconduct and the
   seriousness of the current offence, that the proposed sanction was
   neither unreasonable nor unconscionable.

   The Panel imposed the following sanction: a final grade of zero in the
   Course; a five-year suspension; a permanent notation of the offence on
   the Student‚s academic record and transcript; and a report to the
   Provost for publication.

1.

On May 30, 2017, I presided over the Provost's motion to dismiss the Student's appeal

under E. 7(a) of the Code, which gives the Discipline Appeal s Board the power to dismiss an

appeal summarily and without a formal hearing if it determines that the appeal is frivolous,
vexatious or without foundation.

2.

In the alternative, the Provost asks that the stay of the implementation of the Tribunal's

decision as to sanction be lifted pending final resolution of the appeal under E.1 O of the Code.

3.

For the reasons that follow, the Provost's motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.

4.

This matter has a long and complicated history, clearly and comprehensively set out in

the Provost's materials. Some relevant portions of the case's history are set out below.

5.

In July, 2015, the Provost filed four Charges of academic misconduct against the

student. The hearing proceeded on January 27, 2016. Prior to the hearing, the Student was
asked whether she wished to have an adjournment in order to retain counsel. The Student did
not wish to adjourn the matter, and the hearing proceeded as scheduled. That hearing lasted for
about ten (10) hours, and consisted of evidence being heard from the Student's professor; a
dentist who had treated the Student; the Dean's Designate and the Student.

6.

On February 3, 2016, the Tribunal released its findings with respect to the allegations,

concluding that a number of the allegations had been proven and that the Student had engaged
in misconduct. The sanction hearing was scheduled for March 30, 2016.

7.

On March 2, 2016, the Student's first representative, a paralegal, advised that she had

been retained. She was soon provided with information about how to obtain a transcript of the
hearing.
8.

On March 13, 2016, the Student lodged a Small Claims Court action against a reporting

service she had engaged, which had apparently sought payment of a sum for the transcript
being prepared on an expedited basis. The next day, March 14, 2016, there was a case

-3-

conference at which a second representative, a lawyer, advised that he had also been retained
by the Student.

9.

Three days later, on March 17, 2016, the Student moved to adjourn the sanction hearing

and re-open the finding portion of the hearing, as well as to compel two of the Provost's three
witnesses from the January 27, 2016 hearing to attend to be examined out of court under Rule
39.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

10.

Despite being advised that the Rule was not applicable, the Student served one of the

witnesses with a Notice of Examination and when she did not attend, obtained a Certificate of
Non-Attendance against her.

11 .

On March 23, 2016, there was a further case conference and the Chair directed that the

sanction hearing would be adjourned at the Student's request, but required that it be heard no
later than June 30, 2016, and the parties provide their availability for the sanction hearing.

12.

During this time period, there was mention by the Student's representative of psychiatric

assessments and appointments. No psychiatric assessment was produced. There is some
evidence of the Student cancelling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

13.

On April 4, 2016, the two representatives advised that they no longer acted for the

Student and on April 29, 2016, a case conference was held at which the Student did not
participate (either directly or by representative).
14.

On May 3, 2016, the Student was advised that the Chair requested the Student to

provide her availability for the sanction hearing. The availability was not provided and on May 9,
2016, the Chair reiterated that the availability was to be provided.
15.

Following this correspondence, the Student provided her availability and on May 11,

2016, the sanction hearing was rescheduled for June 28, 2016. On May 16, 2016, the Student's

-4-

third representative, a lawyer, advised that he had been retained. The Provost's counsel was
subsequently advised that he was no longer retained.

16.

On June 28, 2016, the sanction hearing proceeded as scheduled. At that hearing, the

Student's fourth representative advised that the Student sought leave to bring a motion for an
order directing the University to provide her with a transcript of the hearing and adjourning the
sanction hearing pending the motion. Leave to bring this motion was denied, as the sanction
hearing had been made peremptory upon the Student, and she had previously been given
numerous opportunities to obtain the transcript.

17.

On August, 5, 2016, the Decision and Reasons were issued for both portions of the

hearing (liability and sanction). On August 19, 2016, at the Student's request, the Provost's
counsel advised that she did not oppose the Student's request for an extension of time to file
her Notice of Appeal from August 26, 2016 to September 23, 2016.

18.

A Notice of Appeal was delivered on September 22, 2016 and the first case conference

(in which the Student's fourth representative participated) was held with me on November 11,
2016. In order to move the matter forward, I issued a Direction on November 15, 2016 directing,
among other things, that the Student order the transcripts required for the appeal, that she serve
and file her Appeal Factum by January 12, 2017 and that the appeal be heard by March 31,
2017. In Order to assist the Student, the Provost's counsel agreed to prepare the Appeal Book
and the ADFG would provide notarized copies of the transcript. These matters were also
included in the Direction.
19.

On December 13, 2016, the ADFG advised that the Student had not ordered all of the

transcripts as required by the November 15, 2016 Direction and in late December, 2016, the
Provost's counsel was advised by a witness in the proceeding that the Student had commenced

-5-

a civil action against her and filed a complaint to her regulator (The Royal College of Dental
Surgeons of Ontario).

20 .

On January 9, 2017, the Student requested a further extension of time to perfect her

appeal; we therefore held a further case conference on January 11, 2017. On January 13, 2017,
I issued a further Direction requiring that the Student deliver the outstanding transcripts, that she
reimburse the ADFG for the copying and notarizing expenses, that she serve and file her
Appeal Factum by January 31, 2017, and that she advise whether she was previously taught by
a specific professor whom the ADFG was canvassing to hear the appeal. I also extended the
time for hearing of the appeal to April 30, 2017 .

21.

Four days later, on January 17, 2017, the Student advised that due to a family

emergency she would not be complying with the timeline set out in the January 13, 2017
Direction. Therefore, on January 19, 2017, I issued a further Direction, directing the Student to
comply with the obligations set out in the Directions of November 15, 2016 and January 13,
2017.
22.

The next day, on January 20, 2017, the fourth representative advised that she no longer

acted for the Student. On January 24, 2017, I issued a further Direction directing the Student to
comply with the obligations set out in the January 19, 2017 Direction.

23.

On February 17, 2017, a further case conference was held in which the Student did not

participate. I directed that the Student or her counsel, if retained, participate in a case
conference on March 10, 2017, and that she provide information as to her efforts to retain
counsel.
24.

On March 7, 2017, in response to a request from me to change the March 10, 2017 case

conference date, the Student indicated that she could not participate in a case conference
before April 28, 2017, as she was "involved with an urgent family matter''. I issued a further

-6-

Direction granting her request to adjourn the case conference until April 28, 2017, and directing
her or her counsel, if retained, to participate in the case conference on that date, as well as to
provide information as to her efforts to retain counsel.

25.

On April 21, 2017, the Student indicated she was unable to participate in any case

conference or "attend legal action".

26.

On April 28, 2017, the case conference proceeded without the Student's participation

and I issued a Direction setting a schedule for the Provost's motion to dismiss the Student's
appeal.

27.

On May 10, 2017, the Student provided the ADFG with a letter from her psychologist,

but did not respond to two requests from the ADFG that they be permitted to forward the
psychologist's letter to the Provost and to me.

28.

On May 30, 2017, the motion to dismiss the Student's appeal was heard. The Student

did not participate.
29.

As can be seen from the above, while the Student had a stated intention to proceed with

her appeal, her actions belie that intention. She has shown repeated disregard for the process,
and looking at the entire history of the matter as the case law requires me to do, I conclude that
she has conducted the proceedings in a vexatious manner.

30.

The history outlined above indicates that the scheduling difficulties began at the sanction

stage of this proceeding, and continued up to and including the motion to dismiss her appeal.
The Student repeatedly did not comply with Directions, did not respond to communications,
commenced proceedings against a reporting service and a witness, and engaged in a pattern of
non-compliance and delay. The Student has shown blatant disregard for the process, the
Directions, and the efforts of the Provost's counsel and the ADFG. She has been granted many

-7-

indulgences, yet has taken alm ost no steps to move the matter forward in a timely way. No
reasonable explanation has been provided for the delay, and no proposed timetable has ever
been adhered to.

31.

I further note that the grounds of appeal rest significantly (alth ough not solely) on

cred ibility findings, matters that were carefully considered and explained by the Tribunal and
that are most difficult to disturb on appeal.

32 .

I therefore dismiss the appeal in accordance with s. E.7(a) of the Code of Behaviour on

Academic Matters.

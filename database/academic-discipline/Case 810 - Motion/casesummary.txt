   The Student

   The Student appealed a finding of guilt of several offences. The
   University brought a motion under s. E.7(a) of the Code to dismiss the
   appeal for being frivolous, vexatious, or without foundation. The
   motion was allowed. While the Student had the stated intention to
   pursue the appeal, their actions belied that intention. The Student
   failed to comply with Tribunal directions, to respond to
   communications, and to meet set timelines. The Student took almost no
   steps to move the matter forward in a timely way, showed blatant
   disregard for the process and the efforts of the Provost's counsel and
   ADFG, and commenced two separate proceedings against a reporting
   service and a witness. The Tribunal concluded that the Student had
   conducted the proceedings in a vexatious manner and so dismissed the
   appeal.

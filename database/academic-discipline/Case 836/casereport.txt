II.

Agreed Statement of Facts

4. At the outset of the hearing, the Panel was advised that the Student was pleading guilty
to the first nine charges and that the matter would proceed on the basis of an Agreed
Statement of Facts (attached as Appendix A to this decision). The Panel was also
advised that if the Student's plea was accepted, the University wou ld withdraw the
alternative charge.
5. The Panel also received into evidence a Joint Book of Documents that is referred to in
the Agreed Statement of Facts.
6. As is set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the charges arose out of three petitions
submitted by the Stud ent to the University to receive academic accom modation.
A.

The 2013 Petition

7. The first of these petitions was submitted by the Student to the Committee on Standing
of the Faculty of Arts and Science ("Comm ittee") on December 19, 2013 (the "20 13
Petition").
8. At that time, the Student sought the following academic accommodation :
a. Deferral of an examination MAT135, which was originally scheduled for
December 9, 2013;
b. Deferral of an examination in CHM138, which was origi nally scheduled for
December 18, 2013;
c. Extension of time to complete an essay in NMC388, which was originally due
December 6, 2013;
d. Extension of time to complete an essay in NML455, which was orig inally due on
December 4, 20 13; and

4

e. Deferral of a term test in NMC388, which was originally scheduled for November
27, 2013.
9. In support of the 2013 Petition , the Student submitted, among other documents:
a. a Personal Statement; and
b. two Uni versity Verification of Student Illness or Injury Forms, each purportedly
signed by Dr. Noah Vale: one dated December 8, 20 13, and the second dated
December 18, 2013.
10. The Committee granted this petition as set out in letters dated January 7 and 8, 20 14.
B.

The 2014 Petition

11. On May 2, 20 14, the Student submitted a petition to the Committee seeking a second
deferral of the examination in MAT135 (which was originally scheduled for December 9,
2013, and deferred until April 29, 2014) (the "2014 Petition").
12. In support of this petition, the Student subm itted, among other documents:
a. a Persona l Statement;
b. a purported Receipt of Services from Appletree Medica l Group dated April 27,
2014; and
c. a University Verification of Student Illness or Injury Form, dated May 2, 2014,
which was purportedly signed by Dr. Mada n.
13. The Committee granted the 2014 Petition as set out in a letter dated May 28, 2014.
C.

The 2015 Request for Accommodation

14. On each of Septembe r 28, 2015 and October 19, 2015, the Student did not attend a
tutoria l and also missed a tutori al quiz in HMB265.
15. She soug ht academic accommodation for these missed classes and quizzes by
subm itting documents to the Human Biology Department (the "2015 Request for
Accommodation"). These documents consisted of two further University Verification of
Student Illness or Injury Forms: one dated September 28, 2015, and another dated
October 19, 2015, each purportedly signed by Dr. Noah Vale.

5

16. T he Human Biology Department challenged the authenticity of the October 19 Form. In
response, the Student submitted a purported Receipt for Services from Appletree
Medical Group Inc. dated October 19, 20 15.

A.
Meeting with the Dean 's Designate and Student Admissions Regarding
Documents Submitted in Support of Petitions
17. On December 4, 2015, the Student met with Professor John Britton, Dean's Designate
for Academic Integrity in the Faculty of Arts and Science. During that meeting, the
Student admitted that she had forged , altered and/or falsified documents submitted in
support of her Petitions.
18. In respect of those documen ts, as part of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Student
admits the following:

a. Personal Statements
The Student admits that the Persona l Statement submitted on or about
December 19, 2013 and the Persona l Statement subm itted on or about May 2,
2014 each contained statements that she knew to be false at the time of
submission.

b. University Verification of Student Illness or Injury Forms
The Student admits that she was not seen by Dr. Vale on December 8, 2013, on
December 18, 20 13, on September 28, 2015, or on October 19, 20 15. On each
associated Univers ity Verification of Student Illness or Injury Form (the
December 8 Form, the December 18 Form, the September 28 Form, and the
October 19 Form) the Student forged Dr. Vale's signature and the description of
the nature of the health prob lem he pu rported ly described. The Student adm its
that she knew that these forms had each been forged or altered and contained
false information when she submitted them in an attempt to obtain academic
accommodation.
With regards to the May 2 Form , the Student admits that she increased the
seriousness of the incapacity therein described , and added text that was not
originally present on the Form. She admits that she knew this form had been

6

altered and contained fal se information when she submitted it in an attempt to
obtain academic accommodation.
c. Receipts for Medical Services

The Student admits that knew the April 27 Receipt as well as the October 19
Receipt had been forged or altered and contained false information when she
submitted them in an attempt to obtain academic accommodation .
19. The Student also admits that she knowingly submitted all of the documents and
statements described above understanding that the University of Toronto required
evid ence to be presented in order to grant her requests for accommodation; with the
intention that the University of Toronto rely on them in considering her req uests for
academic accommodation; and in an attempt to obtain an academic advantage.

Ill.

Finding on Charges

20. Following deliberation and based on the submissions of counsel and the facts in the
Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Book of Documents, the Panel concluded that
charges 1 through 9 had been proven with clear and convincing evidence on a balance
of probabilities, and accepted the guilty plea of the Student in respect of those charges.
Given that finding of guilt the University withdrew charg e 10. Th e Pane l therefore makes
no finding with respect to charge 10.

IV.

Penalty

21. The Panel was provided with a further Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission
for Penalty ("JSP").
22. The

Student (represented

by experienced

counsel) and

the University jointly

recommended:
a. a final grade of ze ro in the affected courses;
b. a suspension from the University of four years; and
c.

a notation of this sa nction on th e Stud ent's record and transcript for five years.

7

23. Counsel for the Unive rsity provided submissions on the high threshold required to reject
a joint submission on penalty.
24. As set out by th e Discipline Appea l Boa rd in University of Toronto and S

F

(Case No. 690 - Appeal, October 20, 2014) (" Fernando"), a panel is not obliged or
required to accept a joint submission regarding the sanction of a stude nt who has
comm itted academ ic misconduct. However, the Appea l Board in F

made clear

that a panel should on ly reject a joint submission on pena lty if that submission is
unreasonable, unconscionable, or brings the University's discipline process into
disrepute (Fernando at paragraph 22). This is not such a case.
25. Having heard these subm issions, the Pa nel reviewed relevant past decisions of the
Tribuna l and considered the principles and factors as set out in University of Toronto and
C. (Fil e 1976/77-3; November 5, 1976). In particular, the Panel took the following into
account as relevant to pena lty in this case:
a. The offences involve dishonesty and cal l into question the Student's character.
b. The offences are serious:
i. The Student not on ly falsified numerous documents on a number of
occasions, but also took add itional steps to bolster th e authenticity of
falsified documents when the authenticity of the 2015 Req uest for
Accommodation was challenged.
ii. In repeating her misconduct over a period of several months and in taking
steps to bolster the authenticity of the documents, there is clea r evidence
of intention, deliberation, and knowing deception.
c. The offences raise significant concerns with regards to the fa lsifica tion of thirdparty documents, particularly signed documents from medical professiona ls.
i. In forg ing the medical notes, the Student not only undermi ned the
integrity of the procedure used to assess medical circumstances and
extend accommodations at the University of Toronto, but also risked the
reputation of a practicing medical doctor.
d. A number of mi tigating factors are present:
8

i. The Student has cooperated with the University throughout the discipline
process.
ii. The Student made full admission of her misconduct at her meeting with
the Dean 's Designa te .
iii. The Student is a first-time offender.
iv. As disclosed in the Agreed Statement of Facts and Joint Submission on
Penalty, the Student was facing challeng ing medical and personal
circumstances around the time of the commission of the offences. These
cha llenges include a diagnosed mental health concern that significantly
interfered with the Student's ability to complete her academic obliga tions.
The Student has si nce sought treatment. The Panel received into
evidence a letter from a med ical professional currently treating the
Student regarding the relevant circumstances and the Stud ent's progress
since her misconduct. Although this medical evidence is not sufficient to
excuse the Student's misconduct, the difficult personal and medical
challenges experienced by the Student at or around the time of her
commission of the offences justify a reduction of penalty.
e. The University has agreed with the Student, and the Panel accepts, that the
Student's relationship with the University can be rehabilitated.
26. In contextualizing the JSP, Counsel for the University subm itted that this Tribunal has
more or less consistently imposed five-year suspensions in cases of similar misconduct.
In particular, the Pane l was directed to F

cited above, where the Appeal Panel

noted that "a review of all relevant Tribunal decisions concerned with forgery and
falsification show a consistent pattern" leading to a "five-yea r suspens ion." However,
counsel submitted that the mitigating factors in th is case warranted a slightly lower
suspension of four yea rs.
27. With respect to Counsel's submission on the consistency with which this Tribunal
imposes five-yea r suspensions in cases of this kind, we do not understand the Appeal
Panel in F

to mean that fill Tribunal decisions concerned with forgery and

fa lsifica tion warrant a five-year suspension (see for example University of Toronto and
M. C. (Case No. 733, decided July 3, 2014), wherein a student was suspended for a

9

period of two years for having forged and submitted a medical certificate in support of a
request for accommodation).
28. In any case, as first described in the matter of Mr. C., supra, and as followed in a
preponderance of decisions since, the question of sanction must be answe red with due
regard to relevant mitigating or aggravating factors. Based on the above factors and on
a review of similar cases provided by counsel to the University, the Panel agrees that a
four-year suspension is appropriate in this case.

V.

Decision of the Panel

29. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Panel made the following order:
a. the Student is guilty of nine counts of the academic offence of forgery or falsifying
documents or evidence required by the University, contrary to section B.1.1 (a) of
the Code ;
b. the following sanctions sha ll be imposed on the Student:
i. a final grade of zero in each of the courses MAT 135, CHM138, NMC388,
NML455, and HMB265;
ii. a suspension from the Universi ty for 4 years from the day the Tribunal
makes its order; and
iii. a notation of the sanction on her academic record and transcript for 5
years from the day the Tri bunal makes its order.
c. this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a notice of the
decision of the Tribunal and the sanction or sanctions imposed , with the name of
the student withheld .

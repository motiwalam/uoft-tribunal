   The Student

   Student charged with two offences under s. B.i.3(a), and alternatively,
   under s. B.i.3(b) of the Code. The charges related to allegations that
   the Student twice submitted falsified academic records, including
   presenting a false transcript to a professor, in an effort to mislead
   faculty members into supporting his application to dental school. In
   response to a request by the Student for an adjournment, the Panel
   noted the difficulties the Student had presented to the University in
   its efforts to arrive at a hearing date, and granted the request with
   conditions attached.Â  The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of
   Facts. The Student pleaded guilty to the charges. The Panel accepted
   the guilty plea. The parties submitted a Joint Submission on Penalty.
   The Panel considered past decisions of the Tribunal in similar cases.
   The Student agreed with the University regarding the seriousness of the
   offences, acknowledged the offences, accepted the consequences and
   noted that he was appearing before the Tribunal to take responsibility
   for his actions. The Panel found that the proposed penalty
   appropriately reflected the serious nature of the offences and
   appropriately sent the message that the University took such matters
   seriously. The Panel accepted the Joint Submission on Penalty and
   imposed a recommendation to the President, further to s. C.ii.(b)(i) of
   the Code, that the Student be expelled; a five-year suspension pending
   the expulsion decision; and that a report be issued to the Provost. The
   University requested that the Panel award the cost of external
   disbursements incurred in its efforts to contact the Student and set a
   hearing date. The Panel considered the nature of the Universityâs
   efforts, the Tribunal's decision in the case of Mr. K, s. C.II.a.17(b)
   of the Code and the Studentâs request that, if costs were awarded, he
   be allowed six months to remit payment. The Panel ordered that the
   Student pay the costs requested no later than six months from the date
   of the hearing.

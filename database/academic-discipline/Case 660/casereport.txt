Preliminary

[1]

The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on June 27,
2011 to consider charges under the University of Toronto Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (the "Code") laid against the
Student by letter dated May 11, 2011 from Professor Edith Hillan, ViceProvost, Faculty and Academic Life.

[2]

The Student and the University entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts
("ASF") and a Joint Submission on Penalty ("JSP"), copies of which are
attached to these Reasons as Appendix "A" and "B" respectively.

Hearing on the Facts

[3]

The charges against the Student were as follows:
ENG 817 Charges

1.
On or about March 31, 2010, you knowingly represented as your
own an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another in an
essay that you submitted for academic credit in ENG B17, contrary to
section B.l.1(d) of the Code.
2.
In the alternative, on or about March 31, 2010, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to
obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in
connection to an essay you submitted for academic credit in ENG B17,
contrary to section B.l.3(b) of the Code.
ENG 803 Charges

3.
On or about July 14, 2010, you knowingly represented as your
own an idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another in an
essay that you submitted for academic credit in ENG B03 - contrary to
section B.l.1(d) of the Code.
4.
In the alternative, on or about July 14, 2010, you knowingly
engaged in a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud
or misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to
obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in
connection to an essay you submitted for academic credit in ENG 803,
contrary to section B.l.3(b} of the Code.

2

Particulars

5.
At all material times, you were a registered student at the
University of Toronto.
6.
In Winter 2010, you enrolled in ENG B17, which was taught by
Professor Alexandra Peat. Students in ENG B17 were required to submit
an essay that was worth 30% of the final grade in ENG B17
{"Assignment").
7.
On or about March 31, 2010, you submitted an essay titled "It
Can Be Said Many Ways" ("Lucy Essay") in completion of the Assignment,
and to obtain academic credit in ENG 817.
In the Lucy Essay you knowingly:

8.

a. represented the work of another as your own work; and
b. included in the Lucy Essay ideas, and expressions of ideas,
that were not your own, but were the ideas and expressions
of others, which you did not acknowledge in the Lucy Essay.
9.
For the purposes of obtaining academic credit and/or other
academic advantage, you knowingly committed plagiarism in the Lucy
Essay.
10.
In Summer 2010, you enrolled in ENG 803, which was taught by
Professor Sonja Nikkila. Students in ENG 803 were required to submit a
short interpretative essay of no more than 1200 words, which was worth
25% of the final grade in ENG 803 ("Assignment").
11.
On or about July 14, 2010, you submitted an essay titled
"Namelessness Within Narration" {"Marquez Essay") in completion of the
Assignment, and to obtain academic credit in ENG 803.
In the Marquez Essay you knowingly:

12.
a.

represented the work of another as your own work; and

b.

included in the Marquez Essay ideas, and expressions of ideas,
that were not your own, but were the ideas and expressions of
others, which you did not acknowledge in the Marquez Essay.

3

13.
For the purposes of obtaining academic credit and/or other
academic advantage, you knowingly committed plagiarism in the Marquez
Essay.
[4)

The Student did not attend the hearing but submitted a Consent to the
hearing proceeding in her absence. The Consent confirmed that the
Student understood that, in her absence, the University Tribunal may find
that she had committed an act or acts of academic misconduct, and may
impose sanctions against her as set out in the Code.

[5]

Discipline counsel provided an overview of the ASF.

[6]

The Student, via the ASF, entered a guilty plea to all charges. The
University agreed that if the Tribunal convicted the Student of charges 1
and 3, the University would withdraw charges 2 and 4.

Decision of the Tribunal on Charges

{7]

Following deliberation, based on the facts set out in the ASF and a review
of the documents contained in a Joint Book of Documents ("JBD"), the
Tribunal accepted the Student's guilty plea on all charges. Consequently,
the University withdrew charges 2 and 4, and the Student stood convicted
on charges 1 and 3.

Penalty

{8]

The matter then continued with a hearing into the appropriate sanction.
As noted above, the University and the Student filed a JSP attached to
these Reasons as Appendix B.

[9]

The panel was disturbed by the fact that the Student had committed
plagiarism again, in the present two separate courses in 2010, after she
was caught submitting a plagiarized essay in November 2008. On that
prior occasion, the Student received an academic penalty that resulted in
her failing a course and her academic record and transcript containing a
notation of her academic misconduct until September 1, 2009.
Regrettably, the Student was undeterred from committing plagiarism
again.

[1 O]

The panel noted that the Tribunal in Re M.H.H. (July 12, 2009; Case
Number 521) relied on a previous decision, Re A.K. (November 9, 2007;
Case Number 509), in holding that "the consistent minimum penalty
appears to be a two year suspension" for students convicted of plagiarism.
Here the Student had committed plagiarism on three different occasions,
4

albeit with the present hearing dealing with only two of those occasions in
the same academic year.
[11]

The Tribunal believed that the Student's misconduct was very serious and
that the appropriate penalty range may have quite legitimately included a
recommendation for expulsion. However, the Tribunal also recognized the
importance of showing deference to a JSP unless there were compelling
circumstances to depart from the JSP, and here there were none.

(12)

In light of the facts of this case, the admission of guilt by the Student, and
the joint submission regard ing penalty, the Tribunal accepts the JSP and
orders as follows:
1.

THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:

(a)

a final grade of zero in the course ENG B17 and in the
course ENG 803;

(b)

a suspension from the University commencing June 1, 2011,
for a period of four years, ending on May 31, 2015; and

(c)

the sanction be recorded on her academic record and
transcript from the date of the order until May 31, 2015;

2.
THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the
name of the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto, this 6th day of February, 2012.

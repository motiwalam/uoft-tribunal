Trial Division – s. B.i.1(d) of Code – plagiarism – allegations that Student submitted a purchased essay – Student claimed that the essay was her original work and submitted electronic files and notes to corroborate her claim –  involvement of a person named “Bryan” – metadata analysis revealed Bryan as author of the document – Panel accepted the expert testimony that the only way to explain was if the document was created on Bryan’s computer – Panel found Student’s notes were her own and corroborated her claim to an extent – Panel concluded that Student gave her notes to Bryan who put them into an essay form – finding of guilt – Panel was not convinced Student purchased the essay – not appropriate to backdate commencement of the suspension unless in close proximity to the date of the hearing – Panel backdated the suspension to commence on a date that would allow Student to resume her studies in the summer term – two-year suspension appropriate for first time plagiarism offenders – Panel would have imposed a far more severe penalty had it found the Student purchased the essay – penalty should meet the need for general deterrence without unduly punishing Student – grade assignment of zero for course; two-year suspension; three-year notation on transcript or until graduation, whichever is earlier; report to Provost

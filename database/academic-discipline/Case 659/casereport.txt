Preliminary

[1]

The Trial Division of the University Tribunal was convened on June 27,
2011 to consider charges under the University of Toronto Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters, 1995 (the "Code") laid against the
Student by letter dated May 11, 2011 from Professor Edith Hillan, ViceProvost, Faculty and Academic Life.

[2]

The Student and the University entered into an Agreed Statement of Facts
("ASF") and a Joint Submission on Penalty ("JSP"), copies of which are
attached to these Reasons as Appendix "A" and "B" respectively. The
Tribunal noted that, although the versions of the ASF and JSP provided to
the panel were signed and dated by the University on June 7, 2011, they
were signed but left undated by the Student. The Tribunal requested and
the University provided satisfactory documentation, entered as Exhibit #7
at the hearing, that the Student had, in fact, signed and dated the ASF and
JSP on June 6, 2011.

Hearing on the Facts

[3)

The charges against the Student were as follows:
1.
On or about April 5, 2010, you knowingly represented as your own an
idea or expression of an idea, and/or the work of another in an essay that you
submitted for academic credit in ANT A02 - Introduction to Anthropology:
Society, Culture and Language (the "Course"), contrary to section B.l.1(d) of
the Code.
2.
In the alternative, on or about April 5, 2010, you knowingly engaged in
a form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or
misrepresentation not otherwise described in the Code in order to obtain
academic credit or other academic advantage of any kind in connection to an
essay you submitted for academic credit in the Course, contrary to section
B.l.3(b) of the Code.

Particulars

3.
At all material times, you were a registered student at the University of
Toronto. In Winter 2010, you enrolled in the Course, which was taught by
Professor Maggie Cummings.
4.
Students in the Course were required to submit a writing assignment of
In Search of Respect which was worth 15% of the final grade in the Course
("Assignment").

2

5.
On or about April 5, 2010, you submitted an essay in completion of the
Assignment, and to obtain academic credit in the Course ("Essay").
6.

In your Essay you knowingly:
a.
b.

Represented the work of another as your own work; and
Included in the Essay ideas, and expressions of ideas, that were
not your own, but were the ideas and expressions of others, which
you did not acknowledge in the Essay.

7. For the purposes of obtaining academic credit and/or other academic
advantage, you knowingly committed plagiarism in the Essay.

[4]

The Student did not attend the hearing but submitted a Consent to the
hearing proceeding in her absence. The Consent confirmed that the
Student understood that, in her absence, the University Tribunal may find
that she had committed an act or acts of academic misconduct, and may
impose sanctions against her as set out in the Code.

[5]

Discipline counsel provided an overview of the ASF.

[6]

The Student, via the ASF, entered a guilty plea to charges 1 and 2. The
University agreed that if the Tribunal convicted the Student of charge 1,
the University would withdraw charge 2.

Decision of the Tribunal on Charges

[7]

Following deliberation, based on the facts set out in the ASF and a review
of the documents contained in a Joint Book of Documents ("JBD"), the
Tribunal accepted the Student's guilty plea on charges 1 and 2.
Consequently, the University withdrew charge 2, and the Student stood
convicted on charge 1.

Penalty

[8)

The matter then continued with a hearing into the appropriate sanction.
As noted above, the University and the Student filed a JSP attached to
these Reasons as Appendix B.

[9]

The panel also reviewed a number of Tribunal decisions presented by the
University. The panel noted that the Tribunal in Re M.H.H. (July 12, 2009;
Case Number 521) relied on a previous decision, Re A.K. (November 9,
2007; Case Number 509), in holding that "the consistent minimum penalty
3

appears to be a two year suspension" for students convicted of plagiarism.
Similarly, in Re Y-L.O. (November 8, 2010; Case Number 592), the
Tribunal stated, "the principles that have emerged from the cases over the
years are certainly clear, that a commission of a first offence of plagiarism
usually carries with it a suspension of at least two years." [para. 15)
[1 OJ

The Tribunal concluded that a 2-year suspension proposed in the present
JSP is consistent with the Tribunal's established jurisprudence concerning
a first offence for plagiarism. The Tribunal also agreed that there were no
compelling reasons in this case for departing from the sanction jointly
suggested by the parties in the JSP.

[11)

In light of the facts of this case, the admission of guilt by the Student, and
the joint submission regarding penalty, the Tribunal accepts the JSP and
imposes the following sanction:
1.

THAT the following sanctions shall be imposed on the Student:
(a)

a final grade of zero in the course ANT A02H;

(b)

a suspension from the University commencing June 3, 2011,
for a period of two years, ending on June 2, 2013; and

(c)

the sanction be recorded on her academic record and
transcript from the date of the order until June 2, 2013;

2.
THAT this case shall be reported to the Provost for publication of a
notice of the decision of the Tribunal and the sanctions imposed, with the
name of the student withheld.

Dated at Toronto, this 6th day of February, 2012.

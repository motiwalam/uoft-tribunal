Trial Division – s. B.i.3(a) of Code – forged academic record – student knowingly forged or knowingly made use of two sets of forged documents: (1) a Simon Fraser University (“SFU”) transcript, and (2) various SFU course outlines  – finding of guilt - SFU transcript appears genuine - deterrence is a significant consideration – these offences typically result in recommendations of expulsion in all but exceptional cases - question for the Panel  was whether there were mitigating factors sufficient to tip the scale in favour of a lesser sanction – : a five-year suspension; recommendation that the Student be expelled as per s. C.ii.(b)(i) of Code; removal of 5.00 transfer credits; permanent notation on academic record; and report to the Provost for a publication with the Student’s name withheld.

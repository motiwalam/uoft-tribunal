Discipline Appeal Board – University appeal from sanction – request to set aside the penalty and impose a recommendation for expulsion – Board need grant little deference given its very broad powers – deference given on the issue of credibility did not apply in this case because the Student did not testify – the possibility of expulsion is a real deterrent effect – no extenuating circumstances to justify a lesser sentence than expulsion – concern that if expulsion was not the result in this case, it would be difficult to justify in any case – whether the Student had prior offences should be seen in combination with other factors – nothing to put context around the first offence in a mitigating sense – no remorse or explanation by the Student – guilty plea in its own terms was neutral or irrelevant – Board found it significant that Student continued his misconduct even after being warned by a potential employer – Board rejected the idea that because the act itself is the same on each occasion, they should be considered all as one – little weight on the psychiatrist evidence – the fact that the Student had accumulated enough credits to graduate was not a mitigating factor – Board differentiated the case from A.K.G. on the ground that the circumstances were different – deterrent effect and the harm occasioned to the University by the nature of the offence were the two most important sentencing principles in a serious case such as this – nothing in this case that could blunt or ameliorate the facts of the case or the need for consistency and uniformity in sentencing principles – Appeal allowed – recommendation for expulsion

Discipline Appeals Board – Student appeals on the basis that it was improper for the Trial Division to proceed in the Student’s absence, that the University is required to establish that the Student received notice beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the sanction is unreasonable – request to set aside the finding of the Tribunal’s Panel and order a new hearing – ss. B.i.1(d) and B.i.3(b) of the Code – plagiarism – the Student had reasonable notice of the charges and the hearing – the University has the onus to demonstrate that the Student had reasonable notice of the hearing on a balance of probabilities – once a Panel is satisfied that reasonable notice has been given to a student, the Panel has jurisdiction to proceed in the absence of the student – the Tribunal did not make any error in concluding that the University had discharged its onus to demonstrate that the Student had reasonable notice of the hearing and that they could proceed with the hearing in the Student’s absence – the fairness standard relates to having reasonable notice of the adjudication and, thereby, having the opportunity to attend and be heard – the sanction ordered was appropriately consistent with penalties imposed in similar cases – appeal dismissed – Order of the Tribunal affirmed in its entirety

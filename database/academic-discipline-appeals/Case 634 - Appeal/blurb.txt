Discipline Appeal Board – Student appeal from sanction – appeal limited to the Panel’s recommendation that he be expelled – hearing not attended despite the accommodations Student received regarding scheduling – hearing proceeded in Student’s absence – Student claimed he made every effort to address mistakes and did not attempt to deceive and blamed the prosecution and his supervisor – attempt to introduce new evidence did not meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence – Student’s allegations were contrary to factual findings – deference especially appropriate in cases such as this where credibility was at the heart of the decision – Board would have reached the same conclusion even if it was not for deference – discussion of Chelin factors – deliberate fabrication of research results was a serious and inexcusable offence – detriment to the University exacerbated by the inclusion of fabricated data in a grant proposal – Student did not demonstrate remorse and offered no prospect of rehabilitation – evidence of bad character – deterring misrepresentation of research results must be a significant priority – appeal dismissed

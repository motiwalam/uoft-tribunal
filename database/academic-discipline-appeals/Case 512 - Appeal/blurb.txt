Discipline Appeal Board – University appeal from finding of guilt – Student permitted to graduate - jurisdiction of the Tribunal to impose sanctions ordered, the sanctions did not reflect nature of offence and  sanctions inconsistent with previous decisions - see s. C.ii(b) of the Code - no jurisdiction to entertain appeal due to Student’s graduation and s. C.i.(a)12 of the Code – s. B.1.4 of Code did not detract from s. C.i.(a)12 of Code – requested penalty inconsistent with having allowed Student to graduate and moot due to graduation - amendment of Code appropriate method to address policy concerns – appeal would have been allowed if jurisdiction to do existed and more serious sanction drawn from s. C.ii(b) of the Code – appeal quashed
